## 1. Core Positioning

### The One-Liner (Elevator Pitch)
> "AllSquared is the only platform where UK freelancers and clients can transact with confidence - clear contracts in 5 minutes, FCA-backed escrow, and milestone-based payments. Get paid what you're owed. Pay only for work you approve."

### The Problem Statement (30 seconds)
> "67% of UK freelancers experience late or non-payment. Clients risk paying for work that doesn't meet standards. Existing tools either solve contracts (HoneyBook, Bonsai) OR escrow (Transpact) but never both. AllSquared is the first platform combining UK-compliant contracts with FCA-regulated payment protection - for everyone from web developers to home contractors."

### The Differentiators (Why AllSquared?)
1. **UK-first** - Built for UK law, IR35 compliance, FCA escrow (not US templates)
2. **Escrow-backed** - Money protected until work approved (only platform with this)
3. **Two-sided value** - Protects freelancers from non-payment AND clients from bad work
4. **5-minute setup** - From zero to protected contract faster than hiring a lawyer
5. **2.5% vs 20%** - Cheaper than Upwork's marketplace fees, safer than bank transfers

### FAQ Section

**Q: How is this different from Upwork?**  
**A**: Upwork takes 20% of your earnings and locks you into their marketplace. AllSquared charges 2.5% escrow fees and you keep direct client relationships. Cheaper, more freedom.

**Q: Is my money actually safe in escrow?**  
**A**: Yes. Escrow is held by Transpact, an FCA-authorised institution (like a bank). Your funds are segregated and protected under UK financial regulations.

**Q: What if the client and I disagree?**  
**A**: AllSquared includes dispute resolution. First, you negotiate via in-app chat. If unresolved, our AI mediator suggests a fair split. Still stuck? We connect you with a UK lawyer (£100 fee).

**Q: Can I use my own contract templates?**  
**A**: Yes! Upload your own PDF or Word doc. AllSquared adds the escrow terms and milestone structure.

**Q: What if I only need contracts, not escrow?**  
**A**: Escrow is optional. You can create contracts without escrow (like HoneyBook). But why risk it?

**Q: Is this only for tech freelancers?**  
**A**: No. AllSquared works for web developers, designers, consultants, builders, plumbers, electricians, photographers, writers - anyone doing project-based work in the UK.

**Q: How long does escrow release take?**  
**A**: Once a milestone is approved, payment releases in 2-3 business days (standard UK bank transfer time).

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**  
**A**: Yes. Cancel your subscription anytime. Your contracts and escrow remain active until completion.

### r/ContractorUK Post (Value-First Approach)

**Title**: How I protect myself from client non-payment (without legal fees)

**Body**:

After losing £12K when a client went bust last year, I rebuilt my contract workflow. Thought I'd share what's worked:

**The old way (risky)**:
1. Client and I agree on Slack
2. I send a Google Doc contract
3. Client says "looks good" (doesn't sign)
4. I deliver work
5. Client ghosts / goes bust / "cash flow issues"
6. I'm SOL (lawyer wants £5K retainer)

**The new way (protected)**:
1. Create proper UK contract (I use AllSquared but you can use any tool)
2. Client e-signs (legally binding)
3. **Client deposits into escrow** (FCA-regulated, like a bank holds it)
4. I deliver milestone
5. Client approves → money auto-releases
6. If disputed → resolution process (not just me vs client)

**Key insight**: Escrow isn't just for Upwork. Transpact, Payoneer, and newer tools (AllSquared, etc.) offer escrow for direct clients. 2-3% fee, but worth it for peace of mind.

**What changed for me**:
- Sleep better (money is already secured before I start)
- Clients like it too (they only pay for approved work)
- No more awkward "where's my payment" emails

**IR35 note**: Escrow doesn't affect IR35 status (you're still a contractor). It's just a payment protection layer.

Anyone else using escrow for freelance work? What's your experience?

[Comment from "Eli" account after 1-2 hours]:

> Full disclosure: I built AllSquared (the tool I mentioned) because of this exact problem. Happy to answer questions about how escrow works or share our UK contract templates. Not trying to pitch, genuinely want freelancers to stop losing money to non-payment.

### r/FreelanceUK Post (Direct Launch)

**Title**: [Launch] Built a UK freelance contracts + escrow platform (after losing £12K to client bankruptcy)

**Body**:

**TL;DR**: AllSquared combines AI contracts, FCA-backed escrow, and milestone payments. Built for UK freelancers tired of chasing invoices. First 100 users get 50% off Pro for life.

**Backstory**:
Lost £12K last year when a startup client went bust mid-project. Looked for tools to protect myself. HoneyBook used California law (useless in UK). Upwork had escrow but took 20%. Built my own.

**What it does**:
1. Generate UK-compliant contracts (AI-powered, 5 min setup)
2. Client deposits into FCA-regulated escrow
3. Milestone-based payments (work done = money released)
4. Dispute resolution if things go wrong

**Who it's for**:
- Developers, designers, consultants (£1K-25K projects)
- Builders, plumbers, electricians (£5K-50K projects)
- Anyone tired of "cash flow is tight" excuses

**Pricing**:
- Free: 1 contract/month
- Pro: £29.99/month unlimited contracts
- Escrow: 2.5% fee (vs Upwork's 20%)

**Launch offer**:
First 100 signups get **50% off Pro for life** (£14.99/month). Code: **LAUNCH100**

**Links**:
- Site: allsquared.uk
- 2-min demo: [Loom video]

**Questions I expect**:
- "Why not just use a lawyer?" → Lawyers charge £300/hour. This is £15/month.
- "Is escrow legit?" → FCA-regulated (same rules as banks).
- "What about IR35?" → Doesn't affect your status (just payment protection).

Fire away with questions. I'm here all day.

**Email 2b: Day 3 (If contract not created)**

**Subject**: Stuck? Here's how to create your first contract

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

I noticed you haven't created your first contract yet. Totally normal - new tools can feel overwhelming.

**Here's the easiest way to start:**

1. Think of your next project (even if it's 2 weeks away)
2. Click "New Contract" in your dashboard
3. Fill in client name, project title, and total value
4. We'll generate the rest (you can edit before sending)

**Takes 5 minutes.** Seriously.

**Common questions:**

**Q: What if I don't have a project right now?**  
A: Create a "test" contract with a fake client (you can delete it later).

**Q: What if my client refuses to use escrow?**  
A: Explain it protects THEM too (only pay for approved work). 95% say yes once they understand.

**Q: Do I need to upgrade to Pro?**  
A: Not yet. Free tier includes 1 contract/month. Upgrade when you need more.

[CTA: "Create Test Contract"]

Reply if you're stuck. I'm here to help.

Hi [Name],

Great! You've created a contract. Now let's send it to your client.

**What happens next:**

1. Click "Send Contract" in your dashboard
2. We email your client with a review link
3. They sign electronically (no printing/scanning)
4. They deposit into escrow (FCA-protected)
5. You start work with confidence

**What your client will think:**

"Wow, [Name] is professional. Escrow protects me too? Let's do this."

Trust me - clients LOVE escrow once they understand it.

[CTA: "Send Contract Now"]

**Nervous?** That's normal. Every freelancer's first escrow contract feels weird. By the third one, you'll wonder how you ever worked without it.

### Press Release Template

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**AllSquared Launches First UK Platform Combining Freelance Contracts with FCA-Backed Escrow**

*Platform aims to solve late payment crisis affecting 67% of UK self-employed workers*

**London, UK - March 15, 2026** - AllSquared, a new UK-based platform, today launched its V2 product combining AI-generated contracts with FCA-regulated escrow, addressing the payment anxiety faced by 4.4 million UK freelancers.

According to IPSE (Independent Professionals & the Self-Employed Association), 67% of UK freelancers experience late or non-payment. Existing solutions either provide contract management (HoneyBook, Bonsai) or escrow services (Transpact), but no platform offers both - until now.

"I lost £12,000 when a client went bankrupt mid-project," said Eli Bernstein, founder of AllSquared. "I looked for tools to protect myself, but everything was either US-focused or required separate contracts and escrow providers. AllSquared solves both problems in one platform built specifically for UK law."

**Key Features:**
- AI-powered contract generation (UK-compliant templates)
- FCA-regulated escrow (money protected until work approved)
- Milestone-based payment releases
- Two-sided protection (freelancers and clients)
- 2.5% escrow fee (vs. Upwork's 20% marketplace fees)

AllSquared serves freelance developers, designers, consultants, and trade contractors (builders, plumbers, electricians) working on projects ranging from £1,000 to £50,000.

"Escrow isn't just for Upwork anymore," Bernstein added. "Any freelancer working with direct clients can now have bank-level payment protection without marketplace lock-in."

The platform launches with a free tier (1 contract/month) and a Pro plan (£29.99/month unlimited contracts). Early users receive 50% off for life using code LAUNCH100.

**About AllSquared:**
AllSquared is a UK-based platform providing contract management and payment protection for freelancers and contractors. Founded in 2025 by Eli Bernstein after experiencing client non-payment, the platform combines AI contract generation with FCA-backed escrow to protect the UK's £30 billion freelance economy.

## 11. Contingency Plans

### If Signup Rate is Low (<20 in first 24h)

**Possible causes**:
1. Messaging doesn't resonate (escrow anxiety?)
2. Pricing too high (£30/month is expensive?)
3. Trust deficit (FCA badge not enough?)
4. Wrong channels (Reddit isn't our audience?)

**Actions**:
- [ ] A/B test landing page headline (AI contracts vs escrow protection)
- [ ] Add video testimonials (human faces build trust)
- [ ] Offer free escrow for first project (remove financial risk)
- [ ] Post in different subreddits (r/webdev, r/SideProject)

### If Signup Rate is High But Conversion is Low (<5%)

**Possible causes**:
1. Onboarding confusing (users don't create contracts)
2. Clients refuse escrow (adoption blocker)
3. Pricing sticker shock (£30/month at checkout)

**Actions**:
- [ ] Add onboarding wizard (guide first contract creation)
- [ ] Email new users within 1 hour (personal welcome)
- [ ] Test £19.99 pricing (lower barrier)
- [ ] Add "Why Clients Love Escrow" explainer video

---

### If Escrow Adoption is Low (<20%)

**Possible causes**:
1. Users don't understand escrow value
2. Clients refuse to deposit (trust issue)
3. Fee too high (2.5% feels expensive)

**Actions**:
- [ ] In-app education (tooltips, videos explaining escrow)
- [ ] Client-side messaging (email templates for freelancers to send)
- [ ] Test 1.5% fee (reduce barrier)
- [ ] Case study: "How escrow saved me £10K" (social proof)
