**Training Module Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** [INSERT DATE]
**Required For:** All customer-facing staff, Support team, Sales team
**Certification Required:** Yes (annual renewal)

---

## Introduction

AllSquared operates in the **unreserved legal services** space under the Legal Services Act 2007. This means we can provide certain services related to contracts and legal documents, but we must be careful not to cross the line into providing legal advice, which is a regulated activity.

This training module will help you understand:
1. What AllSquared staff CAN do
2. What AllSquared staff CANNOT do
3. How to handle common customer scenarios
4. When and how to escalate to LITL solicitors

**Why This Matters:**
- Protects customers from unqualified advice
- Protects AllSquared from regulatory issues
- Maintains our relationship with LITL solicitors
- Builds trust with our users

## Part 1: The Legal Framework

### Reserved vs. Unreserved Legal Activities

**Reserved Legal Activities (We CANNOT do these):**
- Representing someone in court
- Conducting litigation
- Preparing certain property documents
- Probate work
- Notarising documents
- Administering oaths

**Unreserved Legal Activities (We CAN do these):**
- Providing contract templates
- Helping users fill in templates
- Explaining how our platform works
- Providing general legal information (not advice)
- Facilitating document signing
- Managing escrow payments

### The Critical Distinction: Information vs. Advice

| Legal Information (OK) | Legal Advice (NOT OK) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| "Our standard contract includes a 14-day payment term" | "You should use 14-day payment terms for your situation" |
| "Milestone payments are commonly used in freelance contracts" | "You need milestone payments to protect yourself" |
| "The dispute resolution clause allows for mediation" | "You should invoke the dispute clause in your situation" |
| "Here's what each contract section means generally" | "Here's what this clause means for your specific case" |

**Key Principle:** Information is general and educational. Advice is specific to someone's circumstances and tells them what to do.

### 2.2 Template Selection Help

**You CAN:**

- Explain what each template category is designed for
- Describe the general contents of templates

---

## Part 3: What AllSquared Staff CANNOT Do

### 3.1 Contract Interpretation

**You CANNOT:**

- Tell users what specific clauses mean for their situation
- Advise whether a clause is "good" or "bad" for them
- Recommend changes to contract terms
- Interpret how a contract applies to their dispute

**Example of What NOT to Say:**
> ~~"That clause means you could be liable if anything goes wrong. I'd recommend removing it."~~

**Instead Say:**
> "I can explain what that clause type generally does, but for advice on whether it's right for your specific situation, I'd recommend speaking with one of our LITL solicitors who can review your circumstances."

### 3.2 Specific Recommendations

**You CANNOT:**

- Tell users which contract template to use for their specific project
- Recommend specific payment terms
- Advise on liability limits
- Suggest how to structure their agreement

**Example of What NOT to Say:**
> ~~"For a project like yours, you should definitely use our Pro Services template with 50% upfront."~~

**Instead Say:**
> "We have several templates that might be suitable. Here's an overview of each one. If you're unsure which is best for your specific situation, our LITL solicitors can provide personalised guidance."

### 3.3 Dispute Guidance

**You CANNOT:**

- Tell users whether they have a valid claim
- Advise on what outcome they might expect
- Recommend whether to accept a settlement
- Suggest specific dispute strategies

**Example of What NOT to Say:**
> ~~"Based on what you've told me, I think you'd win this dispute. You should reject their offer."~~

**Instead Say:**
> "I'm not in a position to advise on the merits of your dispute, but I can explain how our dispute resolution process works. Would you like me to walk you through the options, including our AI mediation tool and access to qualified mediators?"

### 3.4 Legal Predictions

**You CANNOT:**

- Predict legal outcomes
- Guarantee contract enforceability
- Advise on regulatory compliance
- Interpret laws or regulations for users

## Part 4: Safe Response Templates

### 4.1 When Asked for Legal Advice

**Scenario:** Customer asks "Should I include a limitation of liability clause?"

**Response:**
> "Limitation of liability clauses are commonly included in service contracts to manage risk. Our templates include a standard clause, but whether it's appropriate for your specific situation is something a legal professional could best advise on. Would you like me to explain how our Lawyer-in-the-Loop service works? You can get a 15-minute review call with an SRA-regulated solicitor for a fixed fee."

### 4.2 When Asked About Contract Suitability

**Scenario:** Customer asks "Is this contract suitable for my web design project?"

**Response:**
> "Our Freelance Services template is commonly used for web design projects and includes sections for scope of work, milestones, payment terms, and intellectual property. I can show you a preview of what's included. If you'd like someone to confirm it's right for your specific project, our LITL service offers contract reviews with qualified solicitors."

### 4.3 When Asked to Interpret Clauses

**Scenario:** Customer asks "What does this indemnity clause mean for me?"

**Response:**
> "Indemnity clauses generally require one party to compensate the other for certain losses. I can explain how they typically work in general terms, but for advice on how this specific clause applies to your situation and whether it's appropriate, I'd recommend our LITL legal review service."

### 4.4 When Asked About Disputes

**Scenario:** Customer asks "Do I have grounds to dispute this milestone rejection?"

**Response:**
> "I understand this is a frustrating situation. I'm not able to advise on whether you have valid grounds for dispute, but I can help you with the process. You can raise a dispute through your contract dashboard. Our AI mediation tool will help both parties explore resolution options. If you can't reach agreement, you can escalate to a qualified mediator. Would you like me to walk you through these steps?"

### 4.5 When Asked to Compare Options

**Scenario:** Customer asks "Should I use your contract or the one my client sent?"

**Response:**
> "I'm not in a position to advise on which contract would be better for your specific situation—that's really a judgment that depends on your circumstances and risk tolerance. What I can tell you is that our contracts are designed to be balanced and include escrow protection. If you'd like help comparing the two or understanding the differences, our LITL solicitors can provide that analysis."

## Part 5: Escalation Procedures

### 5.1 When to Escalate

**Escalate to LITL Service when customers:**
- Need specific legal advice
- Have complex contract requirements
- Are involved in active disputes
- Need contract customisation
- Express uncertainty about legal implications
- Mention regulatory concerns

### 5.2 How to Escalate

**Step 1:** Acknowledge their need
> "It sounds like you need some specific guidance on this."

**Step 2:** Explain LITL
> "Our Lawyer-in-the-Loop service connects you with SRA-regulated solicitors who can provide personalised advice."

**Step 3:** Provide options
> "We offer:
> - Quick Legal Review (£99): 15-20 minute call with a solicitor
> - Contract Review (£199): Written review and recommendations
> - Custom Drafting (from £499): Bespoke contract creation"

**Step 4:** Facilitate connection
> "Would you like me to help you book a consultation? I can also provide their contact details if you prefer to reach out directly."

### 5.3 Escalation to Management

Escalate to your supervisor if:
- Customer is threatening legal action against AllSquared
- Customer reports regulatory concerns
- You're unsure whether something is information or advice
- Customer is persistent about wanting advice after deflection

## Part 6: Common Scenarios and Responses

### Scenario 1: Contract Selection

**Customer:** "I'm a photographer doing a wedding shoot. Which template should I use?"

**Good Response:**
> "We have an Event Services template that's commonly used for photography and event work. It includes sections for date and time, deliverables, deposit and payment schedule, and cancellation terms. I can show you what's included. If you want to make sure it covers everything you need, our Quick Legal Review service can have a solicitor check it for you."

**Why This Works:** You're describing what the template contains and offering professional help, not recommending a specific choice.

### Scenario 2: Clause Meaning

**Customer:** "What does 'jointly and severally liable' mean in this contract?"

**Good Response:**
> "In general terms, 'jointly and severally liable' means that each party can be held responsible for the full amount of an obligation, not just their share. So if there are two parties and one can't pay, the other might be responsible for the whole amount. This is common in partnership or joint venture contracts. For advice on whether this is appropriate for your specific situation, I'd recommend speaking with one of our LITL solicitors."

**Why This Works:** You're explaining a general concept without advising whether it's right for them.

### Scenario 3: Dispute Assessment

**Customer:** "My client won't pay because they say the work isn't good enough, but I followed the brief exactly. What should I do?"

**Good Response:**
> "That sounds really frustrating. While I'm not in a position to advise on the merits of your specific situation, I can help you with the process. Here are your options:

> 1. **Direct communication:** Sometimes a call can resolve misunderstandings
> 2. **AI Mediation:** Our platform can help you and your client explore solutions
> 3. **Formal dispute:** You can raise a dispute and the escrow funds will remain protected
> 4. **Mediator escalation:** If needed, a qualified mediator can help

> If you'd like advice on the strength of your position, our LITL service can connect you with a solicitor who handles these situations."

**Why This Works:** You're explaining process options without telling them what to do or assessing their case.

### Scenario 4: Contract Modification

**Customer:** "Can I add a clause that says I keep the deposit if they cancel within 24 hours of the event?"

**Good Response:**
> "Our templates have a customisation section where you can add additional terms. Cancellation and deposit clauses are common in event contracts. I can show you where to add that. However, since contract terms need to be fair under consumer law, I'd recommend having a solicitor review any custom clauses to make sure they're enforceable. Our LITL Contract Review service can do that for a fixed fee."

**Why This Works:** You're helping with the platform feature while flagging that legal review is recommended for custom terms.

## Part 7: Red Flags to Watch For

### Language That Suggests Advice is Being Sought

- "Should I..."
- "Would you recommend..."
- "What's best for my situation..."
- "Is this enforceable..."
- "Do I have a case..."
- "What will happen if..."
- "Am I protected if..."
- "What are my rights..."

**When you hear these phrases:** Pause and think carefully about whether your response provides information or advice.

### Situations Requiring Extra Care

- High-value contracts (>£10,000)
- Employment or contractor disputes
- Property-related work
- Vulnerable customers
- Emotional or angry customers
- Customers who've mentioned consulting lawyers

## Part 8: Self-Assessment Quiz

**Question 1:** A customer asks "Which is better for me—30-day or 14-day payment terms?"

- A) "14-day terms are better because you get paid faster"
- B) "Most freelancers prefer 14-day terms for cash flow"
- C) "Both options are available in our templates. The choice depends on your business needs and what you agree with your client. A LITL solicitor can advise based on your specific situation."

**Correct Answer:** C

---

**Question 2:** A customer says "My contract says net-30 but my client hasn't paid after 45 days. What should I do?"

- A) "You should send a formal late payment notice and charge interest under the Late Payment Act"
- B) "Based on what you've said, you definitely have grounds to claim the money"
- C) "I can explain your options for addressing late payments. You could use our platform's reminder system, explore our dispute resolution process, or consult a LITL solicitor about your specific rights under the contract."

**Correct Answer:** C

---

**Question 3:** A customer asks "Does this template protect me from being sued?"

- A) "Yes, our contracts include standard protective clauses"
- B) "No contract can guarantee complete protection, but our templates include commonly used protective provisions like limitation of liability. For advice on whether these are sufficient for your specific situation and risks, I'd recommend our LITL legal review."
- C) "You should add more liability clauses to be safe"

**Correct Answer:** B
