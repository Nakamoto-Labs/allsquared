## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1. The Business

AllSquared is a UK-based technology startup providing an integrated platform for secure service contracts. Our mission is to eliminate payment disputes and project failures for freelancers, service providers, and their clients. We combine AI-powered contract generation, FCA-backed escrow, milestone-based payment management, and AI-assisted dispute resolution into a single, seamless workflow.

### 1.2. The Problem

The UK's freelance and service economy—comprising **4.4 million self-employed workers** and a **£29.7 billion home improvement market**—is plagued by inefficiency, payment risk, and disputes. Freelancers and SMEs suffer from late payments and scope creep, while clients face deposit risk and substandard work. Existing solutions are fragmented: contract templates lack security, and escrow services lack integrated contract creation, forcing users to patch together incomplete solutions.

### 1.3. The Solution

AllSquared offers a complete, end-to-end solution. Our platform enables users to:

1.  **Generate Contracts:** Create customised, AI-assisted service agreements for unreserved legal activities.
2.  **Secure Payments:** Deposit funds into an FCA-authorised escrow account.
3.  **Manage Milestones:** Link payments to project milestones, ensuring work is approved before funds are released.
4.  **Resolve Disputes:** Access fast, affordable AI-assisted mediation if disagreements arise.

We will initially focus on five high-volume, unreserved service categories: Creative & Digital Services, Consulting & Professional Services, Home Improvement & Trades, Event Services, and general Freelance/Contractor agreements.

### 1.4. Market Opportunity

The Total Addressable Market (TAM) in the UK is substantial, with over 10 million potential users across the freelance and home improvement sectors. The freelance platform market alone is projected to reach **USD 1 billion by 2030**. AllSquared is uniquely positioned to capture this market by serving underserved freelancers, SMEs, and consumers with a solution that no competitor currently offers.

### 1.5. Competitive Advantage

Our competitive advantage lies in our integrated, end-to-end workflow. Unlike competitors who offer standalone contracts (LegalZoom), enterprise CLM (Juro), or escrow-only services (Riverside Escrow), AllSquared is the only platform that seamlessly combines all critical components. Our optional Lawyer-in-the-Loop (LITL) model provides an affordable pathway to professional legal review, building trust and creating a premium revenue stream.

### 1.6. Financial Projections

We project achieving **100,000 active users** and **£19 million in annual revenue** within five years, based on a conservative 1% market penetration. Our blended revenue model (subscriptions, transaction fees, and LITL referrals) ensures diversified income streams. The business is projected to achieve a **56% gross margin** per user.

### 1.7. Funding Request

We are seeking **£750,000 in seed funding** to finance platform development, secure key partnerships, execute our go-to-market strategy, and cover operational expenses for the first 18 months. This investment will enable us to achieve our MVP launch, acquire our first 10,000 users, and validate our unit economics.
