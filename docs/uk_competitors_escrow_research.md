## Market Gaps and Opportunities for AllSquared

### Identified Gaps

1. **No Combined Escrow + Contract Platform:** Current competitors either offer contracts (Juro, LegalZoom) OR escrow (Riverside, ShieldPay), but not both integrated.

2. **No Milestone-Based Service Contracts with Escrow:** Existing platforms don't combine:
   - AI-assisted contract generation
   - Milestone-based payment terms
   - Integrated escrow release
   - Dispute resolution/mediation

3. **Limited Focus on Service Provider-Client Relationships:** Most platforms focus on:
   - B2B corporate contracts (Juro)
   - Consumer legal documents (LegalZoom)
   - Pure escrow without contract generation (Riverside)

4. **No AI-Assisted Dispute Resolution:** While mediation services exist separately, no platform combines:
   - Contract generation
   - Escrow management
   - AI-assisted dispute resolution
   - All in one workflow

### AllSquared's Competitive Advantages

1. **Integrated Workflow:** Contract → Escrow → Milestone Management → Dispute Resolution
2. **Target Market:** Freelancers, contractors, service providers, and their clients (underserved segment)
3. **LITL Model:** AI-assisted with lawyer/mediator oversight for quality and compliance
4. **Unreserved Services Focus:** Operating in unreserved legal services space for faster market entry
5. **FCA Partnership:** Partnering with FCA-authorised escrow providers rather than becoming one
6. **AI-Assisted Mediation:** Unique offering combining AI suggestions with human mediator approval
