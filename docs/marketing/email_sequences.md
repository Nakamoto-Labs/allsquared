## 1. Waitlist Nurture Sequence

### Email 1: Welcome (Day 0)

**Subject:** You're on the list! Here's what AllSquared is building

**Preview:** The end of freelancer payment nightmares is coming...

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Thanks for joining the AllSquared waitlist! You're now among the first to know when we launch.

**What is AllSquared?**

We're building the UK's first platform that combines:
- AI-powered contract generation
- FCA-regulated escrow protection
- Milestone-based payment management
- Fair dispute resolution

**The problem we're solving:**

Every year, freelancers and contractors lose thousands to late payments, scope creep, and disputed work. Meanwhile, clients worry about paying for substandard results.

AllSquared protects both sides.

**What happens next:**

Over the next few weeks, I'll share more about how AllSquared works and some early-access opportunities. Keep an eye on your inbox!

Best,
[Founder Name]
Founder, AllSquared

### Email 2: The Problem (Day 3)

**Subject:** £5,400 — That's what freelancers lose to bad clients

**Preview:** The hidden cost of working without protection...

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Let me share some numbers that might sound familiar:

- **62%** of UK freelancers have experienced late or non-payment
- **30+ days** average time spent chasing overdue invoices
- **£5,400** average lost annually to non-paying clients

And it's not just freelancers. Clients suffer too:

- **34%** have paid deposits that were never returned
- **67%** of homeowners have had a bad experience with tradespeople
- **£4.5 billion** lost annually by homeowners to rogue traders

The current system is broken. Contracts without teeth. Payments without protection. Disputes without resolution.

**That's why we built AllSquared.**

Next time, I'll show you exactly how our escrow system protects both sides.

Best,
[Founder Name]

### Email 3: The Solution - Escrow (Day 7)

**Subject:** How escrow changes everything

**Preview:** Your payment is protected until you say so...

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Today I want to explain the core of AllSquared: **protected escrow payments**.

**How it works:**

1. You agree on the work and price
2. The client deposits funds into escrow
3. The freelancer completes the work
4. The client approves the milestone
5. Funds release automatically

**Why this matters:**

For freelancers: The money exists before you start. No more hoping you'll get paid.

For clients: You only pay for approved work. Your deposit is protected until you're satisfied.

**The key:** The funds are held by Transpact, an FCA-authorised escrow provider (Reference: 546279). This isn't just a promise—it's regulated, secure holding of your money.

**Coming up next:** How our AI generates professional contracts in minutes.

Best,
[Founder Name]

P.S. Questions about how escrow works? Just reply to this email—I read every response.

### Email 4: The Solution - AI Contracts (Day 11)

**Subject:** What if creating contracts took 5 minutes?

**Preview:** AI-powered contracts that actually protect you...

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Let's talk about contracts.

Most freelancers either:
- Use no contract (dangerous)
- Copy something from the internet (unreliable)
- Pay a solicitor hundreds of pounds (expensive)

**AllSquared's AI contract generator changes this.**

**How it works:**

1. Choose your project type (freelance, home improvement, events, etc.)
2. Answer a few questions about your specific situation
3. Our AI generates a professional contract
4. Review, customise, and send for signature

**What makes it different:**

- Templates designed for UK law
- Milestone and payment terms built in
- Escrow protection referenced
- Dispute resolution included
- Plain English everyone understands

**Not sure about something?** Our Lawyer-in-the-Loop service connects you with SRA-regulated solicitors who can review and advise on your specific situation.

Next time: What happens when things go wrong (and how we help fix them).

Best,
[Founder Name]

### Email 5: Upgrade Prompt (Day 14, for free users)

**Subject:** You've created {{contract_count}} contracts — here's how to save

**Preview:** Lower fees, more features, better protection...

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

You've been using AllSquared for two weeks now and created {{contract_count}} contracts. Nice work!

**Here's something to consider:**

On the Free plan, you pay **2.5% transaction fees** on escrow payments.

On **Starter (£15/month)**, that drops to **2.0%**.
On **Pro (£35/month)**, it's just **1.5%**.

**The math:**

If you're processing £5,000/month through escrow:
- Free: £125/month in fees
- Starter: £100/month in fees + £15 subscription = £115 total
- Pro: £75/month in fees + £35 subscription = £110 total

**Plus you get:**
- More contracts per month
- Full AI customisation
- Priority support
- Custom branding (Pro)
- Team features (Pro)
