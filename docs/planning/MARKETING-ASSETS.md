We're building something special: the easiest way for UK freelancers to protect their payments without the legal hassle.

```

**Email 2: Value (Day 3)**

Subject: The real cost of unpaid invoices

```
Hi {firstName},

Quick question: how much time do you spend chasing payments each month?

For the average UK freelancer, it's 5+ hours. That's £500+ of your time—just on admin.

And that doesn't count the stress, the awkward follow-ups, or the projects you had to write off completely.

AllSquared is designed to make all of that disappear:

✅ Escrow means clients pay upfront
✅ Milestones mean regular releases
✅ Automation means no more chasing

You're on our early access list—which means you'll get first dibs when we launch, plus a founding member discount.

Stay tuned,
Eli
```

**Email 3: Social Proof (Day 7)**

Subject: "I finally got paid on time"

```
Hi {firstName},

We've been testing AllSquared with a small group of UK freelancers, and the feedback has been incredible:

"My first contract with AllSquared was £3,500. The client funded escrow in 24 hours—no awkward conversation needed. When I submitted the final milestone, payment hit my account automatically. This is how it should always work." — Sarah M., Web Developer

We're adding final touches before the full launch, but your spot is secured.

Coming soon:
→ 5 contract templates (freelance, trades, events, and more)
→ Simple milestone tracking
→ Instant escrow setup

Excited to show you,
Eli
```

### Onboarding Sequence

**Email 1: Welcome + Quick Win (Immediate)**

Subject: Welcome! Let's create your first contract

```
Hey {firstName},

You're in! Welcome to AllSquared.

Here's how to get the most value in your first 5 minutes:

1. **Create a contract** — Pick a template and answer a few questions. Our AI handles the rest.

2. **Send it to a client** — New project or existing relationship. Either works.

3. **Watch escrow work** — When they fund, you'll see the money secured in your dashboard.

That's it. No more late payments. No more awkward chasing.

→ Create your first contract: {link}

Questions? Reply to this email—I read everything.

Cheers,
Eli
```

**Email 2: Feature Highlight (Day 2)**

Subject: Did you know? Milestone payments change everything

```
Hi {firstName},

Quick tip that transforms how you work:

Instead of one big payment at the end (and hoping it arrives), try this:

**Set up milestones:**
- 25% deposit (upfront)
- 25% on wireframes approval
- 25% on development complete
- 25% on final delivery

Now you're paid throughout the project, not gambling on the end.

AllSquared makes this automatic. When a client approves a milestone, payment releases instantly.

Set up your first milestone contract: {link}

Cheers,
Eli
```

**Email 3: Success Story (Day 5)**

Subject: How Sarah stopped chasing invoices

```
{firstName},

Meet Sarah. Freelance developer. London.

Before AllSquared, she spent Friday afternoons sending "friendly reminder" emails about unpaid invoices. Some clients paid in 30 days. Some in 60. Some... never.

Now? Her process is:
1. Send AllSquared contract
2. Client funds escrow (usually same day)
3. Deliver milestones
4. Get paid automatically

No chasing. No stress. No "checking in" emails.
