# AllSquared Go-To-Market Strategy

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Draft for Review

---

## Bottom Line Up Front

**The play**: Position AllSquared as "Contracts + Escrow for UK freelancers" — the one tool that protects both sides of the deal. Start with high-value contractors (£5K+ projects) where payment anxiety is highest, then expand down-market.

**The gap**: US tools (HoneyBook, Bonsai) dominate contract management but lack UK-specific compliance and escrow. UK tools (Qdos, Kingsbridge) focus on IR35 but don't solve contracts/payments. AllSquared bridges both.

**First 100 customers**: Tech freelancers in London earning £50K+/year. They're payment-anxious, tech-savvy, and hang out in identifiable communities.

## 4. Pricing Strategy

### Recommended: Freemium + Transaction Fees

| Tier | Price | What You Get | Target |
|------|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Free** | £0/mo | 1 contract/month, basic templates, no escrow | Tire-kickers, virality |
| **Starter** | £9.99/mo | 5 contracts, escrow, standard templates | Solo freelancers |
| **Pro** | £29.99/mo | Unlimited contracts, priority support, LITL discounts | Active freelancers |
| **Business** | £99.99/mo | Team features, API, dedicated support | Agencies |

**Plus transaction fees**:
- Escrow: 2.5% of transaction (min £2.50)
- Payment processing: 1.5% + £0.20

### Why This Works
1. **Free tier** drives acquisition (viral contracts)
2. **£9.99** is impulse buy territory
3. **2.5% escrow** competitive with Transpact (0.5-2% + fixed)
4. **Revenue scales** with customer success (more projects = more fees)

### Pricing Validation Needed
- [ ] Survey target customers on price sensitivity
- [ ] A/B test Free vs £4.99 starter
- [ ] Validate escrow fee vs DIY bank transfer

2. **2.5% escrow fee is acceptable** → Survey + conversion data
3. **Community channels convert** → Track source attribution
4. **Escrow is the differentiator** → A/B test with/without escrow messaging
5. **Home improvement is a viable segment** → Phase 2 validation
