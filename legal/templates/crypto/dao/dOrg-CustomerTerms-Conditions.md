**Terms and Conditions Applicable**

**to Customers of dOrg, LLC**

These Terms and Conditions apply to services and deliverables (collectively, "[Projects]{.underline}" and, singly, a "[Project]{.underline}") commissioned through the dOrg LLC DAO protocol (the "[DAO]{.underline}"). By transacting through the DAO, the commissioning party (the "[Customer]{.underline}") agrees to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, which, together with the Project Fulfillment Agreement defined below, will constitute the full and complete agreement between dOrg LLC ("[dOrg]{.underline}") and the Customer relating to the Project.

# Submitting the Project Through a Project Specification Sheet

. Customer will submit a proposed Project to dOrg in the form of a Project Specification Sheet for review through the DAO. (Such Project Specification Sheet may either be posted directly to the DAO by a Customer who also participates directly in the DAO or may be provided to a DAO participant for the participant to post to the DAO.) The Project Specification Sheet will define the scope of the Project and all of the parameters for its performance, including, but not limited to, the following criteria:

## the types of service and the technical requirements for performing those Services;

## the software needed and/or to be updated during the Project, including copies of or links to licensed versions of each piece of software and copies of the relevant software licenses;

## the end goal and/or deliverable(s), including whether testing and acceptance will be required and, if so, the process for the same (including timing, steps, and the process and identity of all involved in signing off on each testing milestone and the final product); 

## whether support and maintenance or delivery, installation, and training services are required, and, if so, how they will be requested and billed (e.g. whether a set number of hours of support services are included in the Project price), which individuals representing Customer will be involved, who will determine when support matters are concluded, etc.; 

## the intellectual property rights and licenses associated with the Services, the deliverables, and any and all software or IT used or produced during the project (for additional details, see Section 4);

## the final deadline, any milestone deadlines, and any other timing requirements;

## the payment rate or amount (including stating whether Project will be paid as a flat fee, by milestone completion, hourly, etc.); 

## the form of digital currency or other digital coin or token that will be used for payment; 

## details on smart contracts or other payment approval protocols used to disburse payments before, during, and after the Project; and

## any other information relevant to performing, vetting, and evaluating the Project.

In addition to the foregoing procedures the Customer may also submit a Customer project using other documentation, provided that the acceptance of such submissions shall be entirely at the discretion of dOrg, which must approve its use via the DAO process, and of the eventual Contractor who will perform the project. If approved and accepted by them, such documentation will be deemed to be the Term Sheet. In the case of a conflict between such other documentation acting as the Term Sheet, and the provisions of these Terms and Conditions, the provisions of these Terms and Conditions will prevail unless such conflict is expressly identified as such and is expressly approved via the DAO process and by the eventual Contractor.

# Acceptance by dOrg and a Contractor

# . Before dOrg will agree to perform a Customer Project, the Project must be approved through the DAO voting protocol and accepted by one or more dOrg Contractors who are approved through the DAO voting protocol to perform the Project. No Project submitted directly to a member, administrative member, agent, Contractor, participant, or other representative of dOrg is approved for completion unless or until (1) it is approved through a DAO vote and (2) one or more DAO Contractors has been approved to perform the Project on behalf of dOrg. A Customer's contact person at dOrg will advise the Customer when the Project has been submitted to a vote (if the Customer did not submit it directly) and the end result of that vote. After a Project is approved by the DAO, then Contractors may submit proposals to complete the Project. Each Customer's contact person at the DAO will inform the Customer whether one or more Contractors is approved to perform the Project, and will provide the necessary information to connect the Customer and the Contractor(s) through the DAO thereafter. Customer's receipt of the notice that one or more Contractors has been assigned to the Project creates a binding agreement between Customer and the DAO for that Project. Customer will not have a contractual relationship with the individual Contractor(s) performing the Project. Any disputes related to the Project should be addressed between Customer and dOrg.  {#before-dorg-will-agree-to-perform-a-customer-project-the-project-must-be-approved-through-the-dao-voting-protocol-and-accepted-by-one-or-more-dorg-contractors-who-are-approved-through-the-dao-voting-protocol-to-perform-the-project.-no-project-submitted-directly-to-a-member-administrative-member-agent-contractor-participant-or-other-representative-of-dorg-is-approved-for-completion-unless-or-until-1-it-is-approved-through-a-dao-vote-and-2-one-or-more-dao-contractors-has-been-approved-to-perform-the-project-on-behalf-of-dorg.-a-customers-contact-person-at-dorg-will-advise-the-customer-when-the-project-has-been-submitted-to-a-vote-if-the-customer-did-not-submit-it-directly-and-the-end-result-of-that-vote.-after-a-project-is-approved-by-the-dao-then-contractors-may-submit-proposals-to-complete-the-project.-each-customers-contact-person-at-the-dao-will-inform-the-customer-whether-one-or-more-contractors-is-approved-to-perform-the-project-and-will-provide-the-necessary-information-to-connect-the-customer-and-the-contractors-through-the-dao-thereafter.-customers-receipt-of-the-notice-that-one-or-more-contractors-has-been-assigned-to-the-project-creates-a-binding-agreement-between-customer-and-the-dao-for-that-project.-customer-will-not-have-a-contractual-relationship-with-the-individual-contractors-performing-the-project.-any-disputes-related-to-the-project-should-be-addressed-between-customer-and-dorg. .unnumbered}

# Projects Not Approved by dOrg or a Contractor. If a Customer submits a Project Specification Sheet to dOrg and either (a) the DAO does not approve the Project or (b) despite approval, no Contractor is approved to perform it, the Customer will be notified that dOrg will not perform the Project. Customer and dOrg may discuss Customer revising and resubmitting the Project Specification Sheet for an unapproved Project for future consideration by the DAO if the parties so desire.

# Rights in the Project

. Any and all licenses and intellectual property rights associated with a Project shall be contained in the Project Specification Sheet for that Project. The default intellectual property rights and licensing arrangements for Projects included below may be varied by a Project Specification Sheet.

## For open source Projects, Customer, Contractor(s), dOrg, and any other person with access to the open source platform may access and use the code and/or other Project deliverables. All parties must adhere to the licensing agreement of the open source software, including (as applicable) making revised source code available to the same degree as the open source software they used.

## For Projects involving proprietary software owned or licensed by the Customer, the Contractor(s) who perform the Project will obtain only a limited license to use the code, IT and/or software required to perform the Project, and the Contractor(s) will transfer all code and other property used or created in the Project and assign all intellectual property rights from the Project back to the Customer or to the relevant license holder(s) specified by the Customer in the Project Specification Sheet, including, but not limited to, those rights associated with computer code, programs, and media now known or hereafter known, discovered, or created.

## For Projects commissioned by the DAO or for which the Project Specification Sheet otherwise specifies will become or remain the property of the DAO or the Contractors, as applicable, licenses and intellectual property rights for the Project deliverable will remain with the DAO and/or shared between the DAO and the contributing Contractors, as specified in the relevant Project Specification Sheets.

# Covenants

. The parties covenant as follows with respect to each Project:

## dOrg will submit Customer Project Specification Sheets for review by the DAO, provide Contractors the Project Specification Sheet if the Project is approved by vote of the DAO and assigned to one or more Contractors, and provide Customer with the Avatar address of the DAO needed to pay for the Project.

## Contractors will perform any Projects which the DAO approves them to perform without making any representations and warranties related to such performance except any explicitly stated in a Project Specification Sheet.

## Customer will not use Project deliverables for any illegal purpose, any purpose or process materially inconsistent with those specified in the Project Specification Sheet, or in violation of the underlying license agreements and intellectual property rights contained therein or associated with software, IT, or code used in the Project.

# Limitation on Liability

. In the event of a dispute between the parties that results in a judgment, award, settlement, or agreement in favor of Customer, the maximum amount of damages dOrg will be liable to pay Customer is a full refund of all payments Customer has made to date for the Project(s) at issue. Contractors will not have any liability to Customer since Customers contract with dOrg, rather than individual Contractors. Neither dOrg nor Contractors shall be liable for any incidental, consequential, indirect or punitive damages, or loss of profit, revenue, or business for any reason, including, but not limited to (i) access to, use of, or inability to use the DAO or any information, services or content available therein; (ii) the breach of any covenant, representation or warranty; (iii) the use or downloading of any software or application owned or operated by the DAO or any third party, in connection with the DAO; or (iv) any errors or omissions in the information, services or content therein, whether based on warranty, contract, negligence, tort, or any other legal theory, and whether or not dOrg or any Contractor was advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation includes, but is not limited to, personal injury and personal property damages.

# Termination

. All Projects are subject to termination by either dOrg or the Customer, upon reasonable notice to the other party. Both dOrg and Customer agree that, where feasible, they will notify the other party of any performance concerns prior to terminating, in order to provide the non-terminating party an opportunity to cure (e.g. to complete performance, submit payment, provide a necessary software license, etc.). Nonetheless, dOrg may terminate a Project for reasons including, but not limited to, Customer's failure to timely pay or to provide any necessary information, approvals, review, or software licenses. Likewise, Customer may terminate for reasons including, but not limited to, failure of dOrg and/or Contractor(s) to timely perform or complete the Project or to produce satisfactory Services. For any Project terminated before completion, Customer will make a partial payment to dOrg for the value of Services rendered as of the termination date, such value to be determined as a pro rata portion of the previously agreed Project price. If Customer prepayments exceed the value of the partially-completed Project, dOrg will refund the amount of prepaid funds that exceeds the value of Services provided to Customer.

# Confidentiality. Due to the publicly-accessible nature of the DAO, all Project details will be available to any participant in the DAO. 

# Indemnification

. Customer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless dOrg and its Contractors, and each of their respective members, administrative members, managers, administrative members, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, licensees, suppliers and third-party clients from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and accounting fees, resulting from (i) any violation of any third party rights, including, without limitation, any IP, copyright, trademark, property, publicity or privacy right by Customer or at the direction of Customer, pursuant to a Project Specification Sheet; (iii) Customer's breach of any representations, warranties and/or covenants contained herein; and (iii) Customer's direct use (if any) of the DAO.

# Governing Law. The Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Vermont, without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws that would require the application of any other law.

# Notices. All notices, requests, demands, claims and other communications (a "Notice") hereunder shall be in writing, addressed to the intended recipient as set forth below:

# Arbitration. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with, or relating to, these Terms and Conditions or any contract performed thereunder or any breach or alleged breach hereof shall, upon the request of either party, be submitted to, and settled by, arbitration before a single arbitrator in Burlington, Vermont. The arbitration shall proceed pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of this Section and otherwise pursuant to and in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (or at any other place or under any other form of arbitration mutually acceptable to the parties so involved). The parties shall agree on a single arbitrator within thirty (30) days after notice from either party seeking or demanding arbitration; provided, however, that if they do not so agree then the arbitrator shall be either the one proposed by Customer or the one proposed by dOrg, to be determined by a toss of the coin (but if only one party proposes an arbitrator, then the arbitrator shall be the one so proposed). The arbitrator shall base the award on applicable law and judicial precedent and, unless both parties agree otherwise, shall include in such award the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the award is based. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive upon the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in the appropriate court of any forum, state or federal, having jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties to the arbitration or as otherwise determined by the arbitrator to be more just and equitable under all the circumstances. Each party shall pay for and bear the cost of its own experts, evidence and counsels' fees except to the extent, if at all, the arbitrator determines that it is more just and equitable under all the facts and circumstances that one party reimburse the other, in whole or in part, for the cost of the other party's experts, evidence and/or counsel fees; provided, however that if either party fails to proceed with the arbitration as provided herein or unsuccessfully seeks to stay such arbitration, or fails to comply with any arbitration award, the other party shall be entitled to be awarded costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, paid or incurred by such other party in successfully compelling such arbitration and/or successfully defending or enforcing the award. The parties shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the arbitration is completed as promptly as reasonably possible, and preferably within not more than ninety (90) days after either party's request for arbitration hereunder.

# No Waiver

. The waiver by dOrg or the Customer of a breach of any term, covenant or condition herein contained shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such term, covenant or condition, or of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term, covenant or condition. No covenant, term or condition of these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed to have been waived or modified by a Party, unless such waiver or modification is in writing and executed on behalf of the Party against whom such waiver or modification is to be enforced.

#  {#section .unnumbered}
