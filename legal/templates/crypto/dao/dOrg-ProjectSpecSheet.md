# Additional Information. The following information or the information provided by link or attachment is also necessary for evaluating this Project Specification Sheet by the DAO and/or for performance of the Project. 

# Agreement. This Project Specification Sheet does not, in and of itself, create a contract between Customer and dOrg or any other parties. If approved by the DAO and awarded to one or more Contractors for completion, then the Project Specification Sheet and the version of the Software Development Terms and Conditions [\[LINK TO FORM VERSION\]]{.mark} fully executed by the parties will form a binding contract for the Project, known as the Agreement. That Agreement, including any exhibits, schedules and attachments, supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to its subject matter, and there are no covenants, promises, agreements, conditions or understandings, written or oral, except as therein set forth. Neither that Agreement, this Project Specification Sheet nor any other part of the Agreement may be amended except by an instrument in writing executed by the party against whom such amendment is to be enforced. 

# Term. The Term of the Agreement will begin when the Agreement is formed, and will run until the latest of (i) the final Project deadline specified herein, (ii) the date on which the final Works or services required by the Agreement is completed and provided (as applicable) to Customer, or (iii) the date on which Customer makes its full and final payment hereunder (if such date is later than dates determined under (i) and (ii)).

# Successors and Assigns.

Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with, or relating to, these Terms and Conditions or any contract performed thereunder or any breach or alleged breach hereof shall, upon the request of either party, be submitted to, and settled by, arbitration before a single arbitrator in Burlington, Vermont. The arbitration shall proceed pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of this Section and otherwise pursuant to and in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (or at any other place or under any other form of arbitration mutually acceptable to the parties so involved). The parties shall agree on a single arbitrator within thirty (30) days after notice from either party seeking or demanding arbitration; provided, however, that if they do not so agree then the arbitrator shall be either the one proposed by Customer or the one proposed by dOrg, to be determined by a toss of the coin (but if only one party proposes an arbitrator, then the arbitrator shall be the one so proposed). The arbitrator shall base the award on applicable law and judicial precedent and, unless both parties agree otherwise, shall include in such award the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the award is based. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive upon the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in the appropriate court of any forum, state or federal, having jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties to the arbitration or as otherwise determined by the arbitrator to be more just and equitable under all the circumstances. Each party shall pay for and bear the cost of its own experts, evidence and counsels' fees except to the extent, if at all, the arbitrator determines that it is more just and equitable under all the facts and circumstances that one party reimburse the other, in whole or in part, for the cost of the other party's experts, evidence and/or counsel fees; provided, however that if either party fails to proceed with the arbitration as provided herein or unsuccessfully seeks to stay such arbitration, or fails to comply with any arbitration award, the other party shall be entitled to be awarded costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, paid or incurred by such other party in successfully compelling such arbitration and/or successfully defending or enforcing the award. The parties shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the arbitration is completed as promptly as reasonably possible, and preferably within not more than ninety (90) days after either party's request for arbitration hereunder.
