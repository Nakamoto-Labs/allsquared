2.  **EXERCISE**.

    1.  **Method of Exercise.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Warrant, Holder

> may exercise this Warrant with respect to any Token, from time to time, on any Business Day on or after the initial Token Structuring Event for such Token and before the Expiration Date, for up to Holder's Portion of Tokens. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, this Warrant may be exercised any number of times by Holder, prior to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the date that is 10 years following the Issue Date, to provide Holder the opportunity to purchase up to Holder's Portion of Tokens following each instance that new Tokens are minted, generated or created following the initial Token Structuring Event for such Token (each, a "***Subsequent Instance***"), and may be separately exercised with respect to each separate Token. This Warrant shall be exercised by submitting a copy of the exercise notice attached hereto as [Exhibit 1]{.underline}, duly executed by Holder, and by payment in a form specified in [Section 2.2]{.underline} hereof of an amount equal to the Warrant Exercise Price or, if applicable, an election to net exercise this Warrant as provided in [Section 2.5]{.underline} hereof for the number of Tokens to be acquired in connection with such exercise.

2.  **Form of Payment.** Payment for Holder's Portion of the Tokens upon each exercise may be made by (a) a check payable to the Company's order, (b) wire transfer of funds to the Company, (c) cancellation of indebtedness of the Company to Holder, (d) by net exercise as provided in [Section 2.5]{.underline} hereof,

> \(e\) transfer of U.S. dollar stablecoins or (f) any combination of the foregoing.

3.  **Delivery of Tokens**. In connection with each exercise pursuant to this [Section 2]{.underline}, the Holder will provide to the Company with a network address to allocate Holder\'s Tokens to upon such exercise (or otherwise upon the applicable date of delivery, as described herein), and the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, such Tokens to such network address. Holder may update such network address by providing written notice in accordance with [Section 8.5]{.underline}; provided, that the Company need not consider such updated network address to be valid until the Company has confirmed receipt of such notice and has approved such updated network address.

4.  **Restrictions on Exercise.** This Warrant may not be exercised if the issuance of the Tokens upon such exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state laws or other regulations, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company upon the advice of counsel. As a condition to each exercise of this Warrant, Holder shall execute a copy of the exercise notice attached hereto as [Exhibit 1]{.underline}, confirming and acknowledging that the representations and warranties set forth in [Section 7]{.underline} as they apply to Holder are true and complete as of the date of exercise. In the event that legal counsel to the Company advises the Company that it is necessary or advisable for regulatory reasons, Holder shall also be required to deliver, as a condition to exercise, an accredited investor verification letter from a qualified third- party verifying that Holder is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of the Securities Act (as defined below). The Holder acknowledges that the Company is not obligated, and the Company has not made any determination, to generate Tokens.

5.  **Net Exercise Election**.

    a.  Upon each exercise of this Warrant and subject to the Transfer Restrictions, Holder may elect to make such exercise without the payment by Holder of any additional consideration, by submitting a copy of the exercise notice attached hereto as [Exhibit 1]{.underline} with the net exercise election selected, duly executed by Holder, for the number of Tokens that is obtained under the following formula:

# X = Y -- (A ÷ B)

> where X = the number Tokens to be issued to Holder pursuant to a net exercise of this Warrant effected pursuant to this [Section 2.5]{.underline}.
>
> Y = the number of Tokens equal to Holder's Portion.
>
> A = the Warrant Exercise Price.
>
> B = the fair market value of one Token, determined at the time of such net exercise as set forth in the last paragraph of this [Section 2.5]{.underline}.

b.  The Company will promptly respond in writing to an inquiry by Holder as to the then current fair market value of one Token. For purposes of the calculation in [Section 2.5(a)]{.underline}, the fair market value of one Token shall be determined by the Company's or Parent's Board of Directors in good faith.

6.  **Notice of Token Structuring Event.** The Company further covenants and agrees to provide Holder with at least ten (10) days' notice prior to a consummation of any Token Structuring Event by a Token Issuer, which notice shall include a description of the Protocol and the Tokens to be issued in such Token Structuring Event (including, without limitation, a description of the number of Tokens that have been issued by a Token Issuer during the term of the Warrant).

```
3.  **ISSUANCE OF TOKENS.**

    1.  **Date of Issuance.** This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately prior to the close of business on the date that it is exercised pursuant to the terms of [Section 2]{.underline} above, and the Person entitled to receive the Tokens issuable upon such exercise shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of record of such Tokens as of the close of business on such date. As soon as practicable on or after such date, and in any event within 2 days following such date of exercise, the Company shall issue and deliver, or cause to be issued and delivered, to the network address specific on the exercise notice attached hereto as [Exhibit 1]{.underline} that the Holder delivers to the Company the Tokens issuable upon such exercise.

    2.  **Restrictions on Tokens.** The Tokens issued upon each exercise of this Warrant may be subject to such restrictions on Transferability as required by applicable law, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company on the advice of counsel and certain additional restrictions on Transferability as may be requested by the Company (the "***Transfer Restrictions***"); provided, that in no event shall the Transfer Restrictions with respect to any particular Token apply at any time after the fourth anniversary of the Token Launch of such Token; and provided further that the Transfer Restrictions applicable to Holder, if any, shall be no more restrictive than the Transfer Restrictions applicable to all Tokens issued (directly or indirectly) to any Insiders. In addition, any such restrictive provisions shall provide that any discretionary waiver or termination of the restrictions of such agreements that are approved by the Board of Directors of the Company or any Token Issuer with respect to any Insider shall apply to Holder, pro rata, based on the number of Tokens held by such parties. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, during any period any Tokens issued pursuant to this Warrant are subject to restrictions on Transfer, Holder may (i) Transfer any Tokens to any Affiliate of the Holder and (ii) exercise the voting and other governance rights linked to such Tokens or deploy them towards staking in accordance with the governance and other rules of the Protocol.

    3.  **Reservation of Tokens.** After each initial Token Structuring Event, the Company shall reserve, or cause to be reserved, for the benefit of the Holder, and not distribute, sell or encumber, or cause to be not distributed, sold or encumbered, the maximum number of Tokens issuable under this Warrant until this Warrant is fully exercised (it being understood that the maximum number of Tokens issuable under this Warrant at any time shall not include the Tokens issuable in connection with Subsequent Instances unless and until a Subsequent Instance occurs). For the avoidance of any doubt, in the event that the Total Network Tokens for any Token is increased at any time following the initial Token Structuring Event for such Token, then Holder's Portion with respect to such Token shall be recalculated to take into account such increase.

4.  **ADDITIONAL COVENANTS.**

1.  **Token Custodians.** Promptly following distribution of any Tokens to the Holders, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to partner with a third-party custodian (including widely available high quality custody solutions such as Anchorage, Coinbase or other Qualified Custodian under SEC rules) so that such custodian will accept and support such Tokens with secure wallet and storage services reasonably following such distribution.

2.  **Sybil Attacks.** Holder and the Company will use reasonable efforts to prohibit their respective employees, Affiliates and the employees of such affiliates from creating multiple accounts primarily for the purpose of participating in any retroactive airdrop of Tokens of the Company.

3.  **Payment of Purchase Price.** The parties hereby agree that at the time of payment of the Purchase Price, payment may be remitted in the form and manner to be mutually determined by the parties.

5.  **EFFECT OF REORGANIZATION, CONSOLIDATION OR MERGER.**

    1.  \(a\) In case of any recapitalization or reorganization of the Company (including the conversion of the Company into a foundation company) or (b) in case the Company shall consolidate with or merge into one or more other corporations or entities, in each case that is not a Deemed Liquidation Event (each, a "***Reorganization Event***"), if after such Reorganization Event, this Warrant is exercisable for Tokens of a corporation or entity other than the Company, then such corporation or entity shall duly execute and deliver to Holder a supplement hereto acknowledging such corporation's or other entity's obligations under this Warrant; and in each such case, the terms of this Warrant shall be applicable to Tokens receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant after the consummation of such Reorganization Event. The Company shall promptly give Holder at least ten (10) days' prior written notice of each Reorganization Event.

    2.  In the event that a Token Issuer completes a Token Structuring Event while this Warrant is outstanding, then this Warrant shall become exercisable for Holder's Portion of such Tokens. The Company covenants and agrees that to the extent that such Token Structuring Event is consummated by any party other than the Company, the Company will, as a condition to any participation in, cooperation with, or transfer or license of rights with respect to, such Token Structuring Event, ensure that the Token Issuer accepts, in writing for the benefit of Holder, the obligation to issue the applicable Tokens to Holder upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms hereof.

> **[Schedule 1]{.underline}**

> Holder hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

1.  **Authorization.** Holder has full power and authority and, with respect to any individual Holder, the capacity to enter into this Warrant. This Warrant, when executed and delivered by Holder, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of Holder, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and any other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and as limited by laws relating to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.

2.  **Purchase Entirely for Own Account**. Holder is acquiring this Warrant for investment for Holder's own account, not as a nominee or agent (other than as set forth on the signature pages hereto), and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof, and Holder has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same or any part thereof. Holder further represents that Holder does not presently have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any Person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such Person or to any third Person, with respect to this Warrant or any part hereof. Holder has not been formed for the specific purpose of acquiring this Warrant.

3.  **Disclosure of Information**. Holder has had an opportunity to discuss the Company's business, management, financial affairs and the terms and conditions of the offering of this Warrant with the Company's management and has had an opportunity to review the Company's facilities.

4.  **Restricted Securities**. Holder understands that this Warrant has not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "***Securities Act***"), by reason of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of Holder's representations as expressed herein. Holder understands that this Warrant is a "restricted security" under applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and that, pursuant to these laws, Holder must hold this Warrant indefinitely unless it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from such registration and qualification requirements is available. Holder acknowledges that the Company has no obligation to register or qualify for resale this Warrant. Holder further acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or qualification is available, it may be conditioned on various requirements including, but not limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period for this Warrant, and on requirements relating to the Company which are outside of Holder's control, and which the Company is under no obligation and may not be able to satisfy.

5.  **Accredited Investor**. Holder is an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.
