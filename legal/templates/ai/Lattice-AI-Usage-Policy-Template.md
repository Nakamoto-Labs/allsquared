What is an AI Usage Policy? 

An AI usage policy is a set of guidelines for a company and its employees that governs how artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can be used. It typically details ethical use, managing risks, and complying with legal and regulatory standards. 

Implementing an AI usage policy isn’t just a procedural step; it’s a commitment to integrating AI into the workplace in a way that is respectful, safe, and innovative. It&#x27;s about moving forward thoughtfully and enthusiastically with the incredible potential of AI.

Purpose of an AI Usage Policy

An AI policy should ensure that AI technologies are used responsibly, aligning with the company’s commitment to ethical business practices. It supports compliance with all relevant laws and regulations while fostering innovation and maintaining public trust.

Promoting Ethical Practices
: AI is a powerful tool, and with great power comes great responsibility. An AI usage policy helps ensure that a company uses AI ethically, respecting values like fairness, transparency, and accountability. It’s about making sure our technological advances are always in harmony with our commitment to doing good.

Staying Ahead of the Law
: As laws around technology evolve, a robust AI usage policy ensures that a company remains compliant with the latest regulations. This isn’t just about following rules—it’s about leading the industry in best practices and setting standards that others aspire to. A thoughtfully crafted AI usage policy guides us in identifying and managing legal risks proactively, ensuring that our innovations are safe and secure for everyone.

Building Trust
: Using AI responsibly helps build trust with customers, partners, and the public. A clear AI usage policy shows that a company is serious about upholding high standards and earning that trust every day.

Empowering Innovation
: With a clear AI usage policy, employees are well-informed about how they can use AI tools creatively, and within boundaries. This boosts confidence and competence, enabling everyone to contribute more effectively and creatively to our projects.

Ensuring Accountability
: By defining specific roles and responsibilities, an AI usage policy ensures that there is clarity and governance around AI initiatives. This helps maintain high standards and fosters a culture of accountability and excellence.

Sample AI Usage Policy

Disclaimer: This sample policy is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. It is a generic template that may not suit your specific circumstances. When adopting or revising a policy, consult legal counsel to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.‍

At the same time, [Company Name] also recognizes that the use of AI can create significant risks for the Company and believes it is essential to establish clear, values-based guidelines for the ethical and responsible use of AI. 

[Company Name] has created this Policy to reflect its commitment to using AI in a way that promotes fairness, accountability, and transparency while complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and ethical standards.

As AI is a rapidly evolving technology, [Company Name] will regularly review and update this Policy to reflect technological advancements, legal developments, and industry best practices.

Scope and Purpose

Scope
: This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and partners who design, develop, implement, manage, or interact with artificial intelligence (AI) systems at [Company Name]. It also reflects the standards [Company Name] expects from third parties using or developing AI systems in collaboration with and on behalf of the Company.

Purpose
: The purpose of this policy is to ensure that AI technologies are used in a responsible, ethical, and legally compliant manner. It aims to maximize the benefits of AI while mitigating risks associated with AI deployment in business operations.

AI Governance

Oversight
: Our AI Governance Committee is composed of members from IT, legal, compliance, and ethics departments. This committee is responsible for overseeing the implementation of AI policies, ensuring compliance with ethical standards, and reviewing AI projects for alignment with organizational values and objectives.

Roles and Responsibilities
: Clear roles and responsibilities will be defined for all employees and stakeholders involved in AI projects. This includes data scientists for model development, IT staff for system integration, and business units for application of AI solutions.

Ethical Guidelines

[Company Name] is committed to the ethical and legal use of AI in all aspects of its business operations. Employees are expected to observe the following principles when using AI:

Respect for Human Rights
: Employees must ensure that AI applications respect human rights, including privacy, freedom of expression, and non-discrimination. [Company Name]’s use of AI will incorporate best practices for promoting fairness, accessibility, and inclusivity. To the extent practicable, any use of AI should assess the likelihood of bias and implement appropriate controls to mitigate the inherent risks of bias in the use of AI. Because the use of AI technology is relatively novel in the commercial context, and best practices and controls to mitigate potential abuse of sensitive information are rapidly evolving, any system that incorporates AI should be regularly reviewed (not less than annually) to ensure that the latest best practices and legal protections are effectively implemented and up to date.

Fairness
: AI systems must be designed and operated to avoid unfair bias, ensuring that decisions are justified and non-discriminatory.

Transparency
 
and
 
Accountability
: Employees must ensure that the implementation of AI is transparent to users, including prospects, customers, and other stakeholders. Further, employees must be able to explain the rationale behind the use of AI in decision-making processes. Depending on the context, affirmative consent or documentation may be required.

Usage Guidelines

The following guidelines are intended to govern employees’ use of generative AI platforms, tools,
and add-ons including but not limited to ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Codex.

General Use
: Personal accounts should not be used for Company-related purposes. Accounts created with Company email addresses/credentials are to be used solely for authorized Company-related activities that comply with this company policy.
