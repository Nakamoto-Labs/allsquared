Proposal for standard contractual clauses for the procurement of artificial intelligence by public organisations

DRAFT
Introductory remarks
These standard contractual clauses have been drafted for public organisations
wishing to procure an AI System developed by an external supplier. These
standard clauses are based on the standard clauses for the procurement of
algorithmic systems developed by the City of Amsterdam in 2018
(https://www.amsterdam.nl/innovatie/digitalisering-technologie/algoritmenai/contractual-terms-for-algorithms/).
The standard contractual clauses presented in this draft are based to a large extent
on the requirements and obligations for high-risk AI Systems included in the Title
III of the proposal for a Regulation on artificial intelligence* ("AI Act"). This
proposal is subject to ongoing negotiations so the clauses will need to be revised to
take into account any changes made and fully align them with the final regulation
adopted by the Council and the European Parliament.
Considering that the proposed AI Act is still under negotiations, public
organisations that decide to use these conditions may do that on a voluntary basis
assessing on a case-by-case basis whether the various sections of these standard
contractual clauses are sufficient and proportionate for procuring a particular AI
System. The standard contractual clauses target in particular AI systems classified
as ‘high-risk’ within the meaning of Article 6 and listed in one of the areas covered
by Annexes II and III of the proposed AI Act. For non-high risk AI the application
of these requirements is not mandatory under the AI Act, but recommended to
improve trustworthiness of AI applications procured by public organisations. Where
appropriate and justified depending on the impact of the system on the individuals
and the society, public organisations may also extend the application of these
clauses to other algorithmic systems that may not be necessarily qualified as ‘AI’ to
cover in addition simpler software rule-based systems, considering that their use in
the public sector may also require in certain cases increased accountability, control
and transparency.
The standard contractual clauses only contain provisions specific to AI Systems and
on matters covered by the proposed AI Act, thus excluding other obligations or
requirements that may arise under relevant applicable legislation such as the
General Data Protection Regulation. Furthermore, these standard contractual
clauses do not comprise a full contractual arrangement. For example, these
standard contractual clauses do not contain any conditions concerning acceptance,
payment, delivery times, applicable law or liability. The standard contractual
clauses are drafted in such a way that they can be attached as a schedule to an
agreement in which such matters have already been laid down.

down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence and amending certain union
legislative acts, COM(2021)206 final.
