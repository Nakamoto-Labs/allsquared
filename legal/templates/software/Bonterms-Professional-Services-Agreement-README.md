# Professional Services Agreement

## About Bonterms
[Bonterms](https://bonterms.com/) is simplifying commercial contracting through Standard Agreements. Our [Standard Agreements](https://bonterms.com/#standard-agreements) let the parties start from a balanced foundation and negotiate by Cover Page, not redlines. The [Bonterms Platform](https://bonterms.com/platform/) leverages our Standard Agreements to take collaborative dealmaking to the next level. Bonterms is lawyer-led and funded by XYZ Capital and Wilson Sonsini.

## How the Professional Services Agreement was Created
The PSA was drafted by the [Bonterms Standard Agreement Committee](https://bonterms.com/committee/). The PSA went through seven major drafts and multiple meetings, surveys and discussions over eight months.

## How to Use
