3.3.	Change Orders. 

(a)	Change Request. Either Customer or Provider may request a change to Deliverables, Services or other elements of a SOW upon notice to the other party (“**Change Request**”). 

(b)	Change Order. Within 10 days of receipt of a Change Request, each party’s Project Leads will meet (virtually or in person) to discuss the Change Request. Provider will then prepare a change order describing proposed changes to the SOW, including any adjustments to the schedule, fees or expenses (a “**Change Order**”). 

(c)	Implementation. Change Orders are not binding unless executed by both parties. If the parties are unable to agree on resolution of a Change Request, either party may commence an Escalation Process.

(c)	Remediation. Provider will have 15 days following receipt of a Review Notice to remedy the identified nonconformance and resubmit the Deliverable for subsequent review in accordance with this provision.

(d)	Termination Remedies. If Customer terminates the SOW, (i) Provider will promptly refund to Customer any fees paid for the rejected Deliverable (and any related element of the Services the value of which was materially degraded due to absence of the Deliverable) and any pre-paid, unused fees and (ii) Customer will be relieved of paying any further fees under the SOW. 

(e)	Warranty Independent. Acceptance under this provision will not affect any warranty obligation of Provider under this Agreement.

3.5.	Subcontractors. Provider may not subcontract any element of the Services without the prior approval of Customer.

4.	Communication and Escalation.

4.1.	Project Leads. Customer and Provider will specify in each SOW (a) an individual with responsibility and authority to operate as their company’s key point of contact and decisionmaker (a “**Project Lead**”) and (b) another individual with more senior executive authority to serve as their point of escalation (“**Escalation Lead**”).  

4.2.	Project Updates. Provider’s Project Lead will provide regular updates to Customer’s Project Lead on the status of the Services and Deliverables, including with respect to delivery dates or other timeframes specified in the SOW.

4.3.	Escalation Process.

To the extent the Project Leads are unable to resolve the issue within 10 days, either party may request a meeting of the Escalation Leads and within 10 days of such request, the Escalation Leads will use reasonable and good faith efforts to resolve the matter. The process described in this Section is the “**Escalation Process**.”   

**5.	Creation of Deliverables**.

(e)	Waived Rights. If Provider has any rights in an Assigned Deliverable that cannot be assigned to Customer (including any moral rights, such as the right to be named as author, the right to modify, the right to prevent mutilation and the right to prevent commercial exploitation), Provider hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives the enforcement of such rights (“**Waived Rights**”) and waives and quitclaims to Customer all Actions of any kind against Customer and its licensees (through multiple tiers) with respect to Waived Rights.

(g)	Attorney-in-Fact. In the event that Customer is unable for any reason, after reasonable effort, to secure Provider’s signature on any document needed in connection with the actions specified in this Section 6.3, Provider hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Customer and its duly authorized officers and agents as Provider’s agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on its behalf to execute, verify and file any such documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the purposes of this Section 6.3 with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Provider.

7.4.	No Litigation.

14.5.	Immunity for Disclosures to Government or Court by Provider. This Section 14.5 applies only if Provider is an individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in accordance with Section 1833(b) of Title 18 of the United States Code (Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016), Provider will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made (a) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (b) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Additionally, if Provider sues Customer for retaliation based on the reporting of a suspected violation of law, Provider may disclose a trade secret to Provider’s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, so long as any document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and the individual does not disclose the trade secret except pursuant to court order.

**15.	Required Disclosures**. The recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by Laws. If permitted by Law, the recipient will give the discloser reasonable advance notice of the required disclosure and reasonably cooperate, at the discloser’s expense, to obtain confidential treatment for the Confidential Information.

Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement, with notice to the other party, in connection with the assigning party’s merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any non-permitted assignment is void. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns.

17.7.	Waivers and Severability. Waivers must be signed by the waiving party’s authorized representative and cannot be implied from conduct.

17.8.	Force Majeure. Neither party is liable for a delay or failure to perform this Agreement due to a Force Majeure. If a Force Majeure materially adversely affects delivery of the Services for 15 or more consecutive days, either party may terminate the affected SOW(s) upon notice to the other and Provider will refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the SOW Term. However, this Section 17.8 does not limit Customer’s obligations to pay fees owed.
