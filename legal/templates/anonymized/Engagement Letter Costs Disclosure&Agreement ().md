Dear Mark,

Engagement Letter - Costs Disclosure and Agreement

Thank you for this opportunity to work with you. It is my pleasure to provide you with this engagement letter which also contains our cost disclosure and agreement. We have prepared this letter based on the information you have provided to me in previous meetings.

Professional Fees 

(a) Monthly fee

  We will charge you the monthly fee of [AMOUNT] plus GST. This fee will cover the legal services set out in the Scope of Work that we provide to you on a monthly basis.

  This fee is a genuine estimate of our professional fees for the work we will do every month and is not a fixed quote. The total costs may exceed the estimate. While the estimate is based on present information, your instructions and our current understanding as to what services are required, our costs may exceed the estimate if further information becomes available or circumstances change which affect these matters.

  We will monitor the volume of work you request us to do and if your requests are likely to exceed the monthly fee, we will notify you and seek your prior approval before incurring any further fees.

  We understand that the monthly fee is consistent with your budget. We will do all we can stay within your budget, and we will, upon request, send you regular updates so that you always have a real time understanding of legal spend.

Some of the variables which may affect and change the costs estimate include:

(i) significant increases in communication;

(ii) significant increases in volume of work requested;

(iii) your prompt and efficient response to requests for information or instructions;

(iv) whether your instructions are varied;

(v) whether documents have to be revised in light of varied instructions;

(vi) other lawyers or other persons with whom we deal and the level of co-operation of the lawyer’s clients and other persons involved;

(vii) changes in the law; and

(viii) the complexity or uncertainty concerning legal issues affecting your matter.

(b) Hourly Rates

  The Initial fee and any further fees are based on the following hourly rate:

(i) Chris Elias, Principal at [AMOUNT]per hour, plus GST.

  For hourly rate matters, you will be proportionately charged for work involving shorter periods less than an hour. Our charges are structured in 6 minute units. For example, the time charged for an attendance of up to 6 minutes will be 1 unit and the time charged for an attendance between 6 and 12 minutes will be 2 units.

  Our rates are reviewed on a regular basis and may change during the course of a matter. In relation to lengthy matters this may impact upon our cost estimates (which may be revised accordingly). You will be given 30 days' notice in writing of any changes to our charge out rates.

Disbursements 

We may incur disbursements (being money which we pay or are liable to pay to others on your behalf). Disbursements may include search fees, court filing fees, process server fees, expert fees, witness expenses, travel expenses, transcript expenses, third party lawyer fees and barrister's fees. 

Where you instruct us to consult a third party lawyer, brief a barrister or other expert and they provide a disclosure and costs agreement we will provide this to you.

Once you have reviewed and understood this engagement letter and the General Terms of Business, please sign this document. If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Thank you again for this opportunity and we look I look forward to working with you.

Our tax invoices will specify the interest rate to be charged.
