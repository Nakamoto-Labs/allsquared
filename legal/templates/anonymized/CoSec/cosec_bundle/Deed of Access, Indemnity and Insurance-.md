3.  Obligations of the Company

The Company must:

a.  keep, in chronological order at its Registered Office: [ADDRESS]

    i.  all Board Papers of the Company; and

    ii. at least one copy of the Board Papers of the Company,

4.  Right to copy Board Papers

    b.  Copies of Board Papers will be made at the relevant Group Company's cost.

5.  Return of documents

If the Officer requests access to any document that is or refers to a Privileged Document, the Company must notify the Officer:

7.  Waiver of privilege

    a.  Subject to clause ‎2.7(b), if the Officer requests access to a document that is or refers to a Privileged Document, the Company must waive, and must procure that each other Group Company which is entitled to claim legal privilege in respect of that Privileged Document waives, its claim to such privilege but only if the loss of the right to claim privilege in respect of that Privileged Document would not, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, result in material prejudice to any Group Company.

then the Company may:

i.  impose such conditions on the Officer's access to that document as it determines, in good faith, are appropriate to ensure that the ability of a Group Company to claim privilege in respect of that document is not jeopardised by such access; or

ii. if the Company determines in good faith and acting reasonably that it is not possible to ensure, by the imposition of conditions, that the ability of the Group Company to claim privilege in respect of that document would not be jeopardised by such access, refuse to permit the Officer to have access to that document.

c.  If the Company:

    i.  imposes conditions on the Officer's access to a document in accordance with clause ‎2.8(b)(i); or

    ii. refuses to permit the Officer to have access to a document in accordance with clause ‎2.8(b)(ii),

    i.  is a King’s Counsel or Senior Counsel;

    ii. practises at the Western Australian Bar; and

    iii. has company law expertise;

c.  in advising whether the decision is reasonable, the Counsel will act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and his or her written determination will be final and binding on the Officer and the Company; and

d.  the costs of obtaining such opinion from the Counsel will be paid for by the Company.

10. Officer's obligations

    a.  Without limiting the Officer's right to disclose Information under clause ‎7, the Officer must not waive any privilege of a Group Company nor do or omit to do anything that will cause that privilege to be waived or lost, without the prior consent of the Company.

    b.  If the Officer obtains access to Records or Board Papers subject to conditions imposed by the Company under clause ‎2.8(c) or as a result of Counsel’s opinion given under clause ‎2.9, the Officer must comply with those conditions.

11. Access permitted under the Act

Despite any other provision of this document, if and to the extent that the Act gives the Officer the right to inspect a Record or Board Paper that is, or refers to, a Privileged Document, the Company must allow the Officer to inspect and have access to that Record or Board Paper in accordance with the Act.

        i.  owed by the Officer to the Company or any Group Company;

        ii. which arises out of a material or wilful breach of officer’s duties;

        iii. to the extent that, the Officer is not permitted to be indemnified by law;

        iv. that is owed to a person other than the Company or any Group Company and did not arise out of conduct in good faith; or

        v.  where, and to the extent that, the Officer is indemnified under a policy of insurance or otherwise.

    b.  The Indemnity will not extend to Relevant Costs if they are incurred:

        i.  in defending Proceedings in which the Officer is found to have a liability for which the Officer is not indemnified for under clauses ‎3.2(a)(i) to ‎3.2(a)(iv);

        ii. in defending or resisting criminal proceedings in which the Officer is found guilty;

        iii. in defending or resisting Proceedings brought by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) or a liquidator for a court order if the grounds for making the order are found by the court to have been established, other than Relevant Costs incurred in responding to actions taken by ASIC or a liquidator as part of an investigation before commencing Proceedings for the court order;

        iv. in connection with Proceedings for relief to the Officer under the Act in which a court denies the relief;

        v.  in connection with Proceedings brought against the Officer by a Group Company approved by the Board or the Board's delegate provided that if any such Proceedings are unsuccessful the Company must reimburse the Officer all of his costs on an indemnity basis; or

        vi. in connection with Proceedings initiated by the Officer, other than a cross-claim to join a Group Company to any action brought against the Officer.

3.  Rights of Indemnity

The rights conferred on the Officer under clause ‎3.1:

a.  continue to exist in favour of the Officer after the Officer ceases to be an officer of a Group Company for any reason whatsoever; and

b.  are in addition to, and not in limitation of, any rights or indemnities which the Officer may, by law or otherwise, have against the Company or a Group Company.

4.  Notification and settlement of claims

    1.  Notification of Claims

        a.  The Officer must:

            i.  notify the Company and any relevant Group Company in writing as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any case, no later than 15 Business Days) after becoming aware of any Claim that is anticipated, threatened or commenced against the Officer by virtue of the Officer's position in the Company or a Group Company;

            ii. provide such information to the Company on the Claims and the Relevant Costs as the Company reasonably requests from time to time;

            iii. keep the Company fully informed of all information of which the Officer becomes aware in relation to any Claims or circumstances which give rise to, or could reasonably be expected to give rise to, a Liability indemnified under clause ‎3; and

            iv. if she receives any originating proceedings that may give rise to any Claims under the Indemnity, supply those documents to the Company within 15 Business Days.

        b.  Subject to clauses ‎4.2 and ‎4.3, the Officer may control all Investigations and Proceedings arising out of any Claims or circumstance which gives rise to, or could reasonably be expected to give rise to, a Liability indemnified under clause ‎3.

    2.  Obligations of the Officer

In respect of a Claim, the Officer must:

a.  take reasonable steps to mitigate the Officer’s losses for the Claim;

b.  give reasonable assistance and cooperation (including giving the Company documents, records, authorities or directions) when reasonably requested by the Company (or its insurers);

c.  do anything reasonably necessary or desirable to enable the Company to be subrogated to and enjoy the benefits of the Officer's rights to any cross-claims or any claims against any third party;

d.  not admit any Liability for, settle or compromise a Claim without the prior written consent of the Company (or its insurers); and

e.  keep the Company (or its insurers) fully informed of the status and conduct of a Claim if the Company or its insurers have not assumed conduct of the Claim under clause ‎4.3.

3.  Control of a Claim by the Company

If the Company agrees to provide indemnification or a loan or advance (or other funding) under this Deed in respect of a Claim, the Company is entitled to have management and control of all Investigations and Proceedings arising out of a Claim and, without limiting the generality of the above, may do one or more of the following, subject to clauses ‎4.4 and ‎4.6:

a.  assume, either by itself or with an insurer on behalf of the Officer, the conduct, negotiation or defence of the Claim including any appeal;

b.  lodge a defence, cross claim or counter claim or institute proceedings against a third party in the name of the Officer in relation to the Claim;

c.  settle the Claim or any related Proceedings with the consent of the Officer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld;

d.  retain lawyers in relation to the Claim to act on behalf of the Officer; or

e.  as far as legally possible, be subrogated to the rights of the Officer against a third party in respect of the Claim and any Liability resulting or arising from the Claim, unless an insurer is entitled to be subrogated to such rights.

4.  Conduct of a Claim

If the Company acts under clause ‎4.3, the Company must:

a.  instruct its lawyers on behalf of both the Company and the Officer so that legal professional privilege attaches to any documents produced by those lawyers for the benefit of both the Company and the Officer; and

b.  in relation to the conduct of Investigations and Proceedings arising out of a Claim:

    i.  consult with the Officer;

    ii. have regard to the reputation of the Officer and must not take (or omit to take) any action that would be likely to cause significant harm to the reputation of the Officer, except where the Company considers in good faith and on reasonable grounds that the interests of a Group Company or the conduct of the Claim would be materially prejudiced if the Company does not take (or omit to take) that action; and

    iii. keep the Officer fully and progressively informed.

5.  Subrogation rights

Subject to clause ‎4.6, if the Company pays an amount to the Officer under the Indemnity in respect of a matter then (at the Company’s cost):

a.  the Officer must take all steps reasonably requested by the Company to subrogate the Company to any rights of the Officer against any person in respect of that matter; and

b.  if subrogation does not occur the Officer must take all action as the Company reasonably requests to pursue his rights against any person in respect of that matter and the Officer must account to the Company for any amounts recovered from that person.

6.  Conflicts of interest

    a.  Clauses ‎4.2, ‎4.3 and ‎4.5 do not apply if:

        i.  the Claim is by a Group Company (or their insurers) against the Officer; or

        ii. both the Officer and any one or more Group Company are defendants or respondents to a Claim and:

            A.  in the reasonable opinion of the Officer, there is an actual or potential conflict of interest between the Officer and any one or more of the Company and the relevant Group Company in the conduct of the Claim; and

            B.  the Officer gives written notice to the Company that the Officer seeks to have management and control of the Claim, and the Company does not object.

    b.  If the Company does give written notice to the Officer under clause ‎4.6(a)(ii)(B) that it objects to the Officer having the management and control of the Claim, then:

        i.  the Company must refer the matter to Counsel (to be mutually agreed upon by the Officer and the Company) to determine whether the dispute regarding the management and control of the Claim;

        ii. failing agreement as to the identity of Counsel within 5 days after the Company gives its notice of objection to the Officer, the Company will instruct the President for the time being of the Western Australian Bar Association or his or her nominee to appoint a barrister who:

            A.  is a King’s Counsel or Senior Counsel;

            B.  practises at the Western Australian Bar; and

            C.  has company law expertise;

        i.  in determining the dispute regarding the management and control of the Claim, the Counsel will act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and his or her written determination will be final and binding on the Officer and the Company; and

        ii. the costs of obtaining such opinion from the Counsel will be paid for by the Company.

    c.  Until the dispute over the management and control of the Claim is determined by Counsel, the Officer will have management and control of the Claim.

7.  Settlement of Claims

If the Officer withholds consent to settle a Claim under clause ‎4.3(c), the Company must, or must get its insurers to, relinquish to the Officer control of the conduct of the Claim to the extent that it relates to the Officer and in which case the Liability of the Company for the Claim is limited to the total of:

a.  the amount for which the Claim could have been compromised or settled; and

b.  the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Officer up until that time.

8.  Separate legal representation

Despite any other provision in this document, the Officer may engage separate legal or other representation for a Claim. The Company must pay expenses incurred by the Officer in relation to such separate legal representation if the expenses are not excluded under the Indemnity and are incurred:

a.  before the Company or its insurers assume conduct of the Claim;

b.  with the prior written consent of the Company; or

c.  where there is a reasonable likelihood that the interests of the Officer and the Company would conflict if the same lawyer acted for both the Company and the Officer.

5.  Payment under Indemnity

    1.  Payment when Officer becomes liable

If the Officer becomes liable to pay any amount for which the Officer is or is entitled to be indemnified under this Deed, the Company must pay that amount to the person to whom the amount is due within 10 Business Days after the date on which the Officer provides evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company that the Officer is liable to pay that amount and is entitled to be indemnified under this Deed.

2.  Indemnity before expense incurred

Despite any other provision of this Deed, it is not necessary for the Officer to make any payment before enforcing the Officer's rights under the Indemnity.

3.  Advances to Officer

Subject to clause ‎5.6, the Company must, within 10 Business Days after receiving a request from the Officer to do so, and on such terms (including interest only in the event that any amount advanced in respect of any liability or legal costs becomes an amount in respect of which the Officer is not entitled to be indemnified under the Indemnity) as it thinks reasonable in the circumstances, advance moneys to the Officer to enable the Officer to pay, or to reimburse the Officer for, any legal costs reasonably incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the Officer (before the outcome of the action is known) in defending an action for a liability incurred or allegedly incurred by the Officer as an officer of a Group Company (including any such legal costs incurred after the Officer ceases to be an officer of that Group Company).

4.  Taxation

If for any reason any governmental authority imposes any tax on any sum paid to the Officer under the Indemnity, then the Company must pay to the Officer such additional amount as is required to ensure that the total amount paid, less any tax imposed on such amount, is equal to the amount that would otherwise be payable under the Indemnity.

5.  GST

    a.  In addition to any payment by the Company to the Officer under the Indemnity or otherwise under this Deed, the Company must pay the Officer an amount equal to any GST that is or becomes payable by the Officer on the supply for which the payment is made, provided that no additional amount is payable on account of GST under this clause until the Officer has issued a tax invoice to the Company for that supply.

    b.  Any payment by the Company to the Officer for a liability, cost or expense incurred by the Officer must be reduced by the amount of any input tax credit to which the Officer is entitled for that loss, cost or expense.

    c.  Words or expressions used in this clause ‎5.5 which are defined in the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 have the same meaning in this clause.

6.  Repayment

If the Company advances moneys to the Officer under clause ‎5.3 or otherwise pays or reimburses the Officer (or any other person) in accordance with this Deed in respect of a Liability ("Applicable Costs") incurred by the Officer in relation to a Claim, then:

a.  if, upon the final determination of the Claim (whether as a result of the settlement, withdrawal or final adjudication of the Claim or otherwise), the Applicable Costs become costs in respect of which the Officer is not entitled to be indemnified under the Indemnity, the Officer must, within 10 Business Days after the outcome of the Claim is finally determined:

    i.  repay to the Company the amount advanced or paid by the Company in respect of the Applicable Costs; and

    ii. where the Applicable Costs were advanced to the Officer under clause ‎5.3, pay to the Company the interest (if any) accrued on any advance in accordance with the terms of the advance determined by the Company under clause ‎5.3,

and the Company will be under no obligation to pay or reimburse the Officer for any further liability or legal costs incurred by the Officer in respect of, or arising out of, that Claim:

b.  if, upon the final determination of the Claim (whether as a result of the settlement, withdrawal or final adjudication of the action or otherwise), the Applicable Costs become costs in respect of which the Officer is entitled to be indemnified under the Indemnity, the Officer will not be required to pay to the Company the Applicable Costs and, for the avoidance of doubt, no interest will have been accrued in respect of the Applicable Costs; and

c.  if the Officer also receives payment in respect of some or all of those Applicable Costs under any of the following:

    i.  the D&O Policy maintained under clause ‎6 or any other insurance policy; or

    ii. an indemnity given by a Group Company (other than the Company),

then the Officer must, within 10 Business Days after receiving payment under the relevant insurance policy or indemnity, pay to the Company an amount equal to the amount recovered by the Officer under the insurance policy or indemnity in respect of the Applicable Costs.

6.  Insurance

    1.  Obligation to insure

To the extent permitted by law and to the extent available in the market, the Company must either:

a.  at all times during the Relevant Period, maintain and pay the premium on a D&O Policy that complies with clause ‎6.2; or

b.  ensure that, at all times during the Relevant Period, a Related Body Corporate of the Company maintains and pays the premium on a D&O Policy that complies with clause ‎6.2.

2.  Terms and conditions of D&O Policy

The D&O Policy must:

a.  cover (but only to the extent required by clause ‎6.2(b)) liabilities incurred by the Officer (or the Company under the Indemnity) responding to a Claim or in respect of, or arising out of, actual or alleged acts or omissions of the Officer that occurred while the Officer was an officer of a Group Company;

b.  be for an amount and on terms and conditions (including premium, insuring clauses, exclusions and excess amounts) as are appropriate and available in the market for a reasonably prudent company in the Company's circumstances acting fairly; and

c.  without limiting clause ‎6.2(b) and at any given time from time to time, be on terms and conditions that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favourable to the Officer than the terms and conditions of any directors' and officer’s insurance policy taken out or made available at the same time by a Group Company in respect of any other officer or former officer of that Group Company in the same or similar position as the Officer.

3.  Exclusions

In accordance with section 199B of the Corporations Act, the Company will not pay a premium on D&O Policy to indemnify liability (other than for legal costs) arising out of:

a.  conduct involving a wilful breach of duty in relation to a Group Company; or

b.  a contravention of sections 182 or 183 of the Corporations Act.

4.  Notice to Officer

The Company must notify the Officer as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company becomes aware that:

a.  the D&O Policy required to be maintained under clause ‎6.1 has been cancelled or not renewed; or

b.  there is a material diminution in the terms of the D&O Policy maintained under clause ‎6.1 for the Officer.

5.  Extension of insurance

Prior to the expiry of the Relevant Period, the Officer may, by written notice to the Company, request that the Company continue to maintain and pay the premium on the D&O Policy required under clause ‎6.1 for a longer period provided that the Officer agrees to:

a.  reimburse the Company for such premiums as are payable in respect of the period after the expiry of the Relevant Period; and

b.  indemnify the Company against any costs associated with maintaining the D&O Policy for the Officer in respect of the period after the expiry of the Relevant Period.

6.  Copies of insurance policies

At the request of the Officer, the Company must provide the Officer with a copy of:

a.  the policy of insurance; and

b.  the certificate of insurance,

in respect of the D&O Policy maintained in accordance with clause ‎6.1 at the time of the request, except where such disclosure would involve a breach of the terms and conditions of the policy.

7.  Confidential information

    1.  Obligations of confidentiality

Without limiting the Officer's duties as an officer of any Group Company, the Officer (both during the period in which the Officer is an officer of a Group Company and after the Officer ceases to be an officer of a Group Company) must:

a.  keep all Information confidential (except to the extent that disclosure is permitted under clause ‎7.2);

b.  must not disclose Information to any person unless and to the extent permitted to do so under clause ‎7.2; and

c.  must not use Information for any purpose other than a Permitted Purpose.

2.  Exceptions

The obligations in clause ‎7.1 do not apply to Information if and to the extent that:

a.  the Information is or comes into the public domain (other than as a result of a contravention by the Officer of this document or any other obligation of confidence);

b.  prior to any disclosure by the Officer, the Information was made known to the Officer by a person other than a Group Company, provided that the Officer reasonably believes, after making reasonable enquiry, that the person did not acquire or disclose the information in or by a breach of an obligation of confidentiality owed to a Group Company;

c.  disclosure of the Information is required by law;

d.  disclosure of the Information is either:

    i.  reasonably necessary for a Permitted Purpose; or

    ii. made in confidence to the legal, financial or taxation advisers of the Officer, or to the Officer's insurer or prospective insurer,

and both of the following conditions has been met:

iii. either:

     A.  no Group Company has the right to claim legal privilege in respect of some or all of that Information or the proposed disclosure of the Information could not reasonably be expected to jeopardise a Group Company's ability to claim such privilege; or

     B.  each Group Company that has the right to claim legal privilege in respect of all or any of that Information (if any) has waived its right to claim such legal privilege to the extent required under clause ‎2.7; and

iv. disclosure of the Information will not cause any Group Company's right to claim legal privilege in regard to any other Information or documents to be waived; or

e.  disclosure of the Information is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the discharge of the duties of the Officer as an officer of a Group Company; or

f.  the Company has given its written consent to the disclosure of the Information, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

9.  Bar to proceedings
