High-level regulatory review – [PARTY] Whitepaper

Disclaimer

We have undertaken a review of the [PARTY] Whitepaper found here (https://[PARTY].gitbook.io/[PARTY]) (the Whitepaper). We have reviewed the Whitepaper to identify general regulatory considerations in relation to financial services and securities laws only. The purpose of this review is to provide [PARTY] general information to help formulate it’s Whitepaper and develop a project strategy. This document is not formal legal advice or legal opinion. Further discussion and review of the facts and the project is required. Before using or relying on any information below, formal legal advice should be sought in the relevant jurisdiction.

Introduction

This regulatory assessment of [PARTY]'s project identifies key concerns within the Tokenomics & FloCoin Utility sections, particularly related to staking mechanisms and deflationary tactics that could be construed as financial services or securities attributes. Recommendations include rephrasing to clarify that staking rewards are compensation for network support, not passive income, and revising deflationary tactics to emphasize functional utility rather than market manipulation. Other document sections such as technology and team descriptions present low regulatory risk. The IDO details and use of funds are flagged for investment-style language suggesting an investment proposition. Overall, the Whitepaper requires some modifications to avoid unnecessary financial services and securities regulations.

The current description may suggest that holders who stake their tokens may receive rewards or benefits derived from the effort of others. To avoid this suggestion, [PARTY] could reword this to describe what staking actually does and the reason for the reward (eg. does staking allow users to provide some computational power/ validator function to the network and in exchange [PARTY] will pay them. in the form of rewards/tokens etc, for providing this function. |
