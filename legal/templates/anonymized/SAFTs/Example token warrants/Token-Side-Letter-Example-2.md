Re:

Token Rights Letter Agreement

Ladies and Gentlemen:
This letter agreement will confirm our agreement that pursuant to and effective as of your purchase of a
Simple Agreement for Future Equity dated on or about the date hereof (the “SAFE”) by and between you
and [PARTY], Inc. (the “Company”), [PARTY] Ventures (the “Investor”) shall be entitled to the following
contractual rights:
1. Token Rights.
(a)
If the Company or any affiliate, foundation or nominee thereof (a “Token Affiliate”)
creates and issues any Tokens, the Investor will be entitled to its Pro Rata Portion of the aggregate
number of such Tokens allocated to the Company’s (or any Token Affiliate’s) employees, officers,
directors, advisors, consultants, stockholders or other investors (collectively, “Insiders”) for no
additional consideration or nominal consideration (such right, the “Token Right”). Any Tokens issued by
the Company or any Token Affiliate to Insiders shall be subject to a minimum one-year lockup period
commencing on the public launch of such Token, provided that in no event shall any restrictions on
transfer with respect to any Token (“Transfer Restrictions”) apply at any time after the fourth
anniversary of the public launch of such Token. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such Transfer
Restrictions shall apply to the Investor unless all Tokens that are issued (directly or indirectly) to Insiders
are subject to Transfer Restrictions at least as onerous as those applicable to the Investor. “Pro Rata
Portion” means the ratio of (i) that the aggregate number of shares of capital stock (on an as-converted
and as-exercised basis, including the conversion of the SAFE and other Convertible Securities, as
applicable) of the Company owned by the Investor and its affiliates bears to (ii) the aggregate number of
shares of capital stock (on an as-converted and as-exercised basis, including the conversion of the SAFE
and other Convertible Securities, as applicable) of the Company, in each case, as of the date such Tokens
are minted, generated or created.
(b)
For the avoidance of doubt, the Token Right excludes any (i) Tokens issued or used solely
for development, testing or experimental purposes, (ii) Tokens that may be created and issued following
the date such Tokens are first issued to non-Insiders (other than any Token Affiliate) pursuant to staking,
rewards or inflationary or dilutive controls; provided, that any such Tokens dilute all Tokens equally and
(x) are issued in accordance with the governance terms of the protocol and not in the sole discretion of
the Company, any Token Affiliate or any Insider, and (y) with respect to any staking or rewards process,
the Investor is allowed to participate in any such staking or rewards process on the same basis as other
participants (any such Tokens, “Autonomously Generated Tokens”), and (iii) non-fungible Tokens
issued in arms’ length transactions in the ordinary course of business; provided that no such disposition
shall be to the Company, any Token Affiliate or any Insider unless the Investor is entitled to participate
in any such disposition on the same basis as other participants (collectively, “Excluded Tokens”).
2. Documentation. In connection with the Equity Financing, the Token Right will be documented
in the form of a warrant or other token purchase right that will be exercisable at the discretion of
the Investor.

3. Termination. The rights described herein shall terminate and be of no further force or effect
upon the earlier of (a) such time as Investor no longer holds any equity interests or convertible
securities of the Company; (b) immediately prior to the consummation of the sale of the
Company’s securities pursuant to a registration statement filed by the Company under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended; and (c) the consummation of a merger or consolidation of
the Company that is effected (i) for independent business reasons unrelated to extinguishing
such rights; and (ii) for purposes other than (A) the reincorporation of the Company in a
different state or (B) the formation of a holding company that will be owned exclusively by the
Company’s equityholders and will hold all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company’s
successors.
4. Miscellaneous. This letter agreement constitutes the sole agreement of the parties and
supersedes all oral negotiations and prior writings with respect to the subject matter hereof. The
laws of the State of Delaware shall govern the validity, interpretation, construction and
performance of this letter agreement, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.
This letter agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
5. Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the SAFE.
