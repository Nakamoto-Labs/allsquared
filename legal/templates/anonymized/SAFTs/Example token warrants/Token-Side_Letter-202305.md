SIDE LETTER TO TOKEN PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Any initially-capitalized term not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given to it in that certain Token Purchase Agreement by and between [CO NAME] a [•][1] (the “Company”) and [Fund Name II L.P.] (“Purchaser”), dated as of ___________ (the “TPA”).

This letter agreement (“Side Letter”) by and between Purchaser and the Company confirms that, in consideration for the purchase of Tokens by Purchaser pursuant to the TPA, the Company hereby agrees as follows:

1.  New Tokens. For any additional Tokens issued by the Company or an affiliate thereof after the Network Launch (“New Tokens”), the Company will automatically issue to the Purchaser a number of Tokens equal to [2.5]%[2] of the New Tokens. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Agreement, the New Tokens shall be subject to Use Restrictions and/or vesting no more restrictive than any other recipient of New Tokens and, for the avoidance of doubt, this right shall not expire upon issuance of any New Tokens to Purchaser. For purposes of clarity, this Section 1 shall not apply to any Tokens issued through token governance or any other decentralized governance processes related to the Network which occur outside the Company’s direct control.

2.  Token & Network Information Rights. For so long as the TPA is outstanding or for so long as Purchaser continues to hold at least 50% of the Tokens issued to it upon conversion of the TPA or other issuance of Tokens to Purchaser, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to send to the Purchaser, upon written request, and subject to atty-clt priv, (i) any board consents, management discussions, internal memoranda or other materials relating to the regulatory treatment, development or plans relating to a Network or Tokens and (ii) the Purchaser may attend all meetings of the Company’s Board of Directors relating to the regulatory treatment, development or plans relating to a Network or Tokens in a nonvoting observer capacity, the Company shall give the Purchaser such representative copies of all notices, minutes, consents, and other materials that it provides to its directors at the same time and in the same manner as provided to such directors. To the extent the Company is unable to provide the foregoing information it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such information for the Purchaser from any available sources.

3.  Financial Information Rights. The Company shall make the following financial information reasonably available upon Purchaser’s reasonable written request: annual budget and business plan for each fiscal year; an income statement and statement of cash flows for each fiscal year; a balance sheet as of the end of each fiscal year; and quarterly and annual unaudited annual financial reports. Each Purchaser’s request should come with 1 month notice for the procurement and delivery of the requested documents. To the extent the Company is unable to provide the foregoing information it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such information for the Purchaser from any available sources.

4.  “MFN” Amendment Rights. The Company may offer and sell Token Purchase Agreements in multiple rounds and on different terms (each a “Subsequent Agreement”). If the Company, or an affiliate thereof, issues a Subsequent Agreement prior to the termination of the TPA, the Company will provide the Purchaser with written notice thereof, copies of any documentation relating to such Subsequent Agreement, or any additional information related to such Subsequent Agreement, whether or not reasonably requested by the Purchaser. In the event the Purchaser determines that the economic terms of the Subsequent Agreement are preferable (“More Favorable Terms”) to the economic terms of the TPA, the Purchaser will have the option to elect to receive the More Favorable Terms by written notification to the Company of such election within 30 days of the Purchaser’s receipt of notice of the Subsequent Agreement. Upon such timely election, the Company and Purchaser will amend and restate the economic terms of the TPA to be identical to the economic terms contained in the instrument(s) evidencing the Subsequent Agreement.

5.  Other Information. The Company shall make such information as is reasonably available to it, its affiliates, management or founders as Purchaser may reasonably request relating to the Network or Tokens.

6.  Survival. Section 1 hereof shall expressly survive any expiration or termination of the TPA pursuant to Section 1(d)(i) of the TPA.
