Events

(a) Equity Financing. If there is an Equity Financing before the termination of this Safe, on the initial
closing of such Equity Financing, this Safe will automatically convert (subject to the Company's obligation to update
its register of members accordingly) into the greater of: (1) the number of Standard Preference Shares equal to the
Purchase Amount divided by the lowest price per Standard Preference Share; or (2) the number of Safe Preference
Shares equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Conversion Price.
In connection with the automatic conversion of this Safe into Standard Preference Shares or Safe
Preference Shares, the Investor will execute and deliver to the Company all of the transaction documents related to the
Equity Financing; provided, that such documents (i) are the same documents to be entered into with the purchasers of
Standard Preference Shares, with appropriate variations for the Standard Preference Shares if applicable; and (ii) have
customary exceptions to any drag-along applicable to the Investor, including (without limitation) limited
representations, warranties, liability and indemnification obligations for the Investor.
(b) Liquidity Event. If there is a Liquidity Event before the termination of this Safe, the Investor will
automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of
Proceeds, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of such
Liquidity Event, equal to the greater of (i) the Purchase Amount (the “Cash-Out Amount”) or (ii) the amount payable
on the number of Ordinary Shares equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price (the “Conversion
Amount”). If any of the Company’s securityholders are given a choice as to the form and amount of Proceeds to be
received in a Liquidity Event, the Investor will be given the same choice, provided that the Investor may not choose to
receive a form of consideration that the Investor would be ineligible to receive as a result of the Investor’s failure to
satisfy any requirement or limitation generally applicable to the Company’s securityholders, or under any applicable
laws.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with a Change of Control intended to qualify as a
tax-free reorganisation, the Company may reduce the cash portion of Proceeds payable to the Investor by the amount
determined by its board of directors in good faith for such Change of Control to qualify as a tax-free reorganisation,
provided that such reduction (A) does not reduce the total Proceeds payable to such Investor and (B) is applied in the
same manner and on a pro rata basis to all securityholders who have equal priority to the Investor under Section 1(d).
(c) Dissolution Event. If there is a Dissolution Event before the termination of this Safe, the Investor
will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of
Proceeds equal to the Cash-Out Amount, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to the consummation of
the Dissolution Event.
(d) Liquidation Priority. In a Liquidity Event or Dissolution Event, this Safe is intended to operate like
standard non-participating Preference Shares. The Investor’s right to receive its Cash-Out Amount is:
(i)
Junior to payment of outstanding indebtedness and creditor claims, including contractual
claims for payment and convertible promissory notes (to the extent such convertible promissory notes are not actually
or notionally converted into Share Capital);
(ii)
On par with payments for other Safes and/or Preference Shares, and if the applicable
Proceeds are insufficient to permit full payments to the Investor and such other Safes and/or Preference Shares, the
applicable Proceeds will be distributed pro rata to the Investor and such other Safes and/or Preference Shares in
proportion to the full payments that would otherwise be due; and
(iii)

Senior to payments for Ordinary Shares.

The Investor’s right to receive its Conversion Amount is (A) on par with payments for Ordinary
Shares and other Safes and/or Preference Shares who are also receiving Conversion Amounts or Proceeds on a similar
as-converted to Ordinary Share basis, and (B) junior to payments described in clauses (i) and (ii) above (in the latter
case, to the extent such payments are Cash-Out Amounts or similar liquidation preferences).
(e) Termination. This Safe will automatically terminate (without relieving the Company of any
obligations arising from a prior breach of or non-compliance with this Safe) immediately following the earliest to
occur of: (i) the issuance of Share Capital to the Investor pursuant to the automatic conversion of this Safe under
Section 1(a); or (ii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Investor pursuant to Section 1(b) or
Section 1(c).

person or group of affiliated persons would hold at least a majority of the total voting power represented by the
outstanding voting securities of the Company or such other surviving or resulting entity, (ii) any reorganisation,
scheme of arrangement, merger, amalgamation or other consolidation of the Company, other than a transaction or

Warrant), and (b) with respect to each subsequent exercise, [AMOUNT](in the aggregate, to purchase that number
of Tokens for which Holder exercises this Warrant).
2.

EXERCISE.

2.1 Method of Exercise. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Warrant, Holder may
exercise this Warrant with respect to any Token, from time to time, on any Business Day on or after the
initial Token Structuring Event for such Token and before the Expiration Date, for up to Holder’s Portion of
Tokens; provided, that, if the Holder’s Portion is increased pursuant to Section 3.4 following any Expiration
Date (a “Post-Expiration Increase”), this Warrant may nevertheless be exercised with respect to such PostExpiration Increase from time to time, on any Business Day on or prior to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the date
that is 10 years following the Issue Date. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, this Warrant may
be exercised any number of times by Holder to provide Holder the opportunity to purchase up to Holder’s
Portion of Tokens following each instance that new Tokens are minted, generated or created following the
initial Token Structuring Event for such Token, and may be separately exercised with respect to each
separate Token. This Warrant shall be exercised by submitting a copy of the exercise notice attached hereto
as Exhibit 1, duly executed by Holder, and by payment in a form specified in Section 2.2 hereof of an
amount equal to the Warrant Exercise Price or, if applicable, an election to net exercise this Warrant as
provided in Section 2.5 hereof for the number of Tokens to be acquired in connection with such exercise.
2.2 Form of Payment. Payment for Holder’s Portion of the Tokens upon each exercise may
be made by (a) a check payable to the Company’s order, (b) wire transfer of funds to the Company, (c)
cancellation of indebtedness of the Company to Holder, (d) by net exercise as provided in Section 2.5 hereof
(e) transfer of U.S. dollar stablecoins acceptable to the Company or (f) any combination of the foregoing.
2.3 Delivery of Tokens. In connection with each exercise pursuant to this Section 2, the
Holder will provide to the Company with a network address to allocate Holder's Tokens to upon such
exercise (or otherwise upon the applicable date of delivery, as described herein), and the Company shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, such Tokens to such network address. Holder may update such network
address by providing written notice in accordance with Section 8.5; provided, that the Company need not
consider such updated network address to be valid until the Company has confirmed receipt of such notice
and has approved such updated network address (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).
2.4 Restrictions on Exercise.

(a) This Warrant may not be exercised if the issuance of the Tokens upon such
exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state laws or other regulations, as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company upon the advice of counsel.
(b) As a condition to each exercise of this Warrant, Holder shall execute a copy of
the exercise notice attached hereto as Exhibit 1, confirming and acknowledging that the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 7 as they apply to Holder are true and complete as of the date of exercise.

(c) In the event that legal counsel to the Company advises the Company that it is
necessary or advisable for regulatory reasons, Holder shall also be required to deliver, as a condition to
exercise, an accredited investor verification letter from a qualified third-party verifying that Holder is an
“accredited investor” within the meaning of Rule 501 of the Securities Act (as defined below). The Holder
acknowledges that the Company is not obligated, and the Company has not made any determination, to
generate Tokens.

2.5 Net Exercise Election. Restrictions, Holder may elect to make such exercise without the
payment by Holder of any additional consideration, by submitting a copy of the exercise
notice attached hereto as Exhibit 1 with the net exercise election selected, duly executed
by Holder, for the number of Tokens that is obtained under the following formula:
X = Y – (A ÷ B)
where

X = the number Tokens to be issued to Holder pursuant to a net exercise of this Warrant
effected pursuant to this Section 2.5.
Y = the number of Tokens equal to Holder’s Portion.
A = the Warrant Exercise Price.
B = the fair market value of one Token, determined at the time of such net exercise as set forth
in the last paragraph of this Section 2.5.

(a) The Company will promptly respond in writing to an inquiry by Holder as to the
then current fair market value of one Token. For purposes of the calculation in Section 2.5(a), the fair market
value of one Token shall be determined by the Company’s or Parent’s Board of Directors in good faith.
2.6 Notice of Expiration and Token Structuring Events. The Company further covenants
and agrees to provide Holder with (i) at least sixty (60) days’ notice prior to any Expiration Date and (ii) at
least fifteen (15) days’ notice prior to a consummation of any Token Structuring Event by a Token Issuer,
which notice shall include (x) in each case, a description of the number of Tokens that have been issued by a
Token Issuer during the term of the Warrant and the Holder’s Portion (including the calculation of such
Portion) and (y) in the case of clause (ii), a description of the Protocol and the Tokens to be issued in such
Token Structuring Event.
2.7 Termination of Warrants. If, pursuant to Section 2.4(a) it is determined by the Board
of Directors acting on the advice of counsel that this Warrant may not be exercised then the Warrant shall
immediately terminate, and any rights of the Holder under this Warrant shall also be terminated at the same
time. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Warrant, the Company covenants and agrees to
provide the Holder with written notice of such determination as soon as reasonably practicable following a
determination made under this Section.
3.

ISSUANCE OF TOKENS.

3.1 Date of Issuance. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately
prior to the close of business on the date that it is exercised pursuant to the terms of Section 2 above, and the
Person entitled to receive the Tokens issuable upon such exercise shall be treated for all purposes as the
holder of record of such Tokens as of the close of business on such date. As soon as practicable on or after
such date, and in any event within 2 days following such date of exercise, the Company shall issue and
deliver, or cause to be issued and delivered, to the network address specific on the exercise notice attached
hereto as Exhibit 1 that the Holder delivers to the Company the Tokens issuable upon such exercise.
Restrictions on Tokens. The Tokens issued upon each exercise of this Warrant may be subject to such
restrictions on Transferability as required by applicable law, as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Company on the advice of counsel and certain additional restrictions on Transferability as may be reasonably
requested by the Company including, but not limited to, an absolute bar on transfer, without prior consent of
the Company, (the “Transfer Restrictions”), provided that such absolute bar on transfer (absent restrictions
required by applicable law) shall be no longer than 24 months following the Token Launch (the “Initial
Lock-up Period”) ; provided, further, that following the Initial Lock-Up Period, such Tokens shall continue to
be subject to the Transfer Restrictions for 24 months following the Initial Lock-up Period until released, with
[PHONE]v1
Doc ID: dc1a5c9dfad[PHONE]cf0ad4639d9a0e7d2348e62

1/24th of the total number of such Tokens released from such Transfer Restrictions each month, starting on the
one month anniversary of the expiration of the Initial Lock-up Period such that no Transfer Restrictions shall
apply to such Tokens after the fourth anniversary of the Token Launch; and provided, further that no such
Transfer Restrictions shall apply to Holder unless all Tokens that are issued (directly or indirectly) to the
Founders, officers, directors, and employees of any of the Company, any Token Affiliate or of any Token
Issuer will be subject to an absolute bar on transfer during the Initial Lock-up Period, and shall be released
from such restriction in no less than twenty-four (24) equal monthly amounts beginning on the one month
anniversary of the expiration of the Initial Lock-up Period and continuing each month thereafter. In addition,
any such restrictive provisions shall provide that any discretionary waiver or termination of the Transfer
Restrictions that are approved by the Board of Directors of the Company or any Token Issuer with respect to
any Insider shall apply to Holder, pro rata, based on the number of Tokens held by such parties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, during any period any Tokens issued pursuant to this Warrant
are subject to restrictions on Transfer, Holder may (i) Transfer any Tokens to any Affiliate of the Holder and
(ii) exercise the voting and other governance rights linked to such Tokens or deploy them towards staking in
accordance with the governance and other rules of the Protocol.
3.2 Reservation of Tokens. The Company shall reserve, or cause to be reserved, for the
benefit of the Holder, and not distribute, sell or encumber, or cause to be not distributed, sold or
encumbered, the maximum number of Tokens issuable under this Warrant until this Warrant is fully
exercised.
3.3 Token Allocation and Distribution. In the event that the Company Reserve for any
Token is increased at any time following the initial Token Structuring Event for such Token, Holder’s
Portion with respect to such Token shall be recalculated to take into account such increase in the number of
Tokens to the Company Reserve. In the event that the Total Network Tokens for any Token is increased at
any time following the initial Token Structuring Event for such Token, then Holder shall be issued a pro rata
portion of the additional Tokens issued in such increase, based upon the number of Tokens held by Holder
relative to the Total Network Tokens prior to such increase.
4.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS.

4.1 Token Allocation and Distribution. Promptly following distribution of any Tokens, the
Company will use reasonable best efforts to partner with a third-party custodian (including widely available
high quality custody solutions such as Anchorage, Coinbase or other Qualified Custodian under SEC rules)
so that such custodian will accept and support such Tokens with secure wallet and storage services
reasonably following such distribution.
4.2 Sybil Attacks & Airdrop Farming. Holder and the Company will use reasonable
efforts to prohibit their respective employees, contractors, Affiliates and the employees and contractors of
Holder’s respective Affiliates from creating multiple accounts primarily for the purpose of participating in
any retroactive airdrop of Tokens of the Company.
4.3 Eligible Tokens. In the event that a Token Issuer completes a Token Structuring Event
while this Warrant is outstanding, then this Warrant shall become exercisable for Holder’s Portion of such
Tokens. The Company covenants and agrees that to the extent that such Token Structuring Event is
consummated by any party other than the Company, the Company will, as a condition to any participation
in, cooperation with, or transfer or license of rights with respect to, such Token Structuring Event, ensure
that the Token Issuer accepts, in writing for the benefit of Holder, the obligation to issue the applicable
Tokens to Holder upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms hereof.

or merge into one or more other corporations or entities, in each case that is not a Deemed Liquidation
Event (each, a “Reorganization Event”), if after such Reorganization Event, this Warrant is exercisable for
Tokens of a corporation or entity other than the Company, then such corporation or entity shall duly
execute and deliver to Holder a supplement hereto acknowledging such corporation’s or other entity’s
obligations under this Warrant; and in each such case, the terms of this Warrant shall be applicable to
Tokens receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant after the consummation of such Reorganization Event.

Schedule 1
Holder hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:
1.1 Authorization. Holder has full power and authority and, with respect to any individual
Holder, the capacity to enter into this Warrant. This Warrant, when executed and delivered by Holder, will
constitute valid and legally binding obligations of Holder, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except
as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and any
other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, and as limited by laws
relating to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.
1.2 Purchase Entirely for Own Account. Holder is acquiring this Warrant for investment
for Holder’s own account, not as a nominee or agent (other than as set forth on the signature pages hereto), and
not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof, and Holder has no present intention of selling,
granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same or any part thereof. Holder further represents
that Holder does not presently have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any Person to
sell, transfer or grant participations to such Person or to any third Person, with respect to this Warrant or any
part hereof. Holder has not been formed for the specific purpose of acquiring this Warrant.
1.3 Disclosure of Information. Holder has had an opportunity to discuss the Company’s
business, management, financial affairs and the terms and conditions of the offering of this Warrant with the
Company’s management and has had an opportunity to review the Company’s facilities.
1.4 Restricted Securities. Holder understands that this Warrant has not been, and will not
be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), by reason of a specific
exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon, among other things, the
bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of Holder’s representations as expressed herein.
Holder understands that this Warrant is a “restricted security” under applicable U.S. federal and state securities
laws and that, pursuant to these laws, Holder must hold this Warrant indefinitely unless it is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from such
registration and qualification requirements is available. Holder acknowledges that the Company has no
obligation to register or qualify for resale this Warrant. Holder further acknowledges that if an exemption from
registration or qualification is available, it may be conditioned on various requirements including, but not
limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period for this Warrant, and on requirements relating to the
Company which are outside of Holder’s control, and which the Company is under no obligation and may not
be able to satisfy.
1.5 Accredited Investor. Holder is an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.
