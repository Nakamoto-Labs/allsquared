Re: Conditional right to purchase Tokens

  This side letter (“Agreement”) confirms that in connection with the execution of the SAFE between Talisman Co Pty Ltd (“Company”) and the party set out in Schedule 1 of the SAFE (“Investor” or “you”), the Investor may be entitled to purchase Tokens pursuant to the terms and conditions in this Agreement.

  “Platform” means the platform to be developed by the Company (or by an entity engaged by the Company), referred to as “Talisman”.

  “Pro Rata Portion” means the percentage amount equivalent to the SAFE Purchase Amount divided by the SAFE Valuation Cap.

  “Retained Tokens” means all Tokens retained by the Company or Token Affiliate (as relevant) following the Token Launch excluding:

(a) Tokens allocated for future distribution to advisors, employees and other service providers as compensation or as consideration for value; and

(b) Tokens otherwise allocated primarily for the purpose of capital expenditures or operational expenses of the Company, as determined by the board of directors of the Company in its sole discretion.

  “SAFE” means the simple agreement for future equity agreement entered into between the Company and Investor on or about the date of this Agreement.

  “Token” and “Tokens” are, in each case, with respect to the Platform:

(a) cryptocurrencies, decentralised application tokens, protocol tokens, cryptographic digital tokens or coins, virtual currencies, blockchain-based assets or other similar digital assets;

(b) instruments exchangeable, exercisable or convertible into the items in paragraph (a); or

(c) instruments, documents, agreements, understandings, contracts or arrangements that provide for the right to receive the items in paragraph (a).

  “Token Affiliate” means any corporate entity (including a company, trust, association, partnership, foundation), enterprise, digital collective governing structure (including decentralised autonomous organisations) or other organisation that:

(a) is not the Company;

(b) is the issuer of the Tokens in the Token Launch

For the avoidance of doubt, a proposed sale, grant, creation, issuance, sponsorship or distribution of any Tokens by the Company or Token Affiliate on behalf of a third party, including a customer of the Company in the ordinary course of business, shall not constitute a Token Offering.

  “Token Sale Agreement” means the sale agreement under which the Company or Token Affiliate (as relevant) will issue Tokens in respect of the Platform.

  Investor’s ability to sell, transfer, spend, exchange or otherwise deal with the Tokens on the Platform until such Tokens are vested under this Agreement.

Conditional right to purchase Tokens

Token Launch

  At a future date, the Company or a Token Affiliate may (but is not obliged to) perform a Token Launch.

Investor’s conditional right

(a) Subject to a Token Launch occurring and applicable law, the Investor has a conditional right to purchase up to its Pro Rata Portion of the Retained Tokens on the same terms and the same price as other eligible participants purchasing Retained Tokens in the initial Token Offering.

  For example: if there are 100 Retained Tokens after the Token Launch and the Investor has a Pro Rata Portion of 20%, the Investor will be eligible to purchase up to 20 Retained Tokens.

(b) When the Investor’s right in clause 2.2(a) arises, the Company or Token Affiliate will provide the Investor with a written notice (“Purchase Notice”) specifying:

    i.  the terms of issue of the Retained Tokens (including a copy of any relevant Token Sale Agreement if applicable);

    ii. the total number of Retained Tokens available for purchase by the Investor up to its Pro Rata Portion; and

    iii. any Use Restrictions that are applicable to the Retained Tokens.

(c) The Investor must notify the Company or Token Affiliate (as relevant) within 20 Business Days (“Exercise Period”) of receiving the Purchase Notice of its election to irrevocably exercise its right under clause 2.2(a) and the number of Retained Tokens (up to its Pro Rata Portion) the Investor wishes to purchase (“Allocated Tokens”).

(d) The Investor acknowledges and accepts that if it fails to notify the Company or Token Affiliate (as relevant) of its election during the Exercise Period, neither the Company nor Token Affiliate is required to issue any Retained Tokens to the Investor and the Investor’s right to purchase Retained Tokens expires.

Completion

(a) If the Investor notifies the Company of its election to exercise its right under clause 2.2(a), the Company or Token Affiliate (as relevant) will give the Investor a notice setting out its Allocated Tokens and the total purchase amount.

(b) Within 5 Business Days of receiving a notice under clause 2.3(a), the Investor must provide the Company or Token Affiliate (as relevant) with:

    i.  an executed copy of the Token Sale Agreement (if applicable);

    ii. the purchase amount; and

    iii. the Investor’s digital wallet address details to issue the Allocated Tokens.

(c) Within 5 Business Days of receiving the items in clause 2.3(b), the Company or Token Affiliate (as relevant) will issue the Allocated Tokens to the Investor’s digital wallet address.

(d) For clarity, neither the Company nor the Token Affiliate are liable for:

    i.  any delayed or failed Token issuance due to congestion on any cryptocurrency network or any other circumstances beyond their reasonable control;

    ii. the Investor nominating a digital wallet address that does not support the Token type; or

    iii. any loss associated with the Investor providing incorrect digital wallet address details.

Conditions

Token purchase subject to conditions

(a) 

(b) Any Tokens issued to the Investor under this Agreement will be subject to:

    i.  the Token Sale Agreement (if applicable), including all requirements, disclaimers, representations, warranties and limitations included therein;

    ii. any reasonable requirements, conditions or restrictions imposed by the Company or Token Affiliate (as relevant) in connection with the issuance of Tokens on the Platform generally. Such requirements, conditions or restrictions will be disclosed to the Investor prior to issuing the Purchase Notice; and

    iii. the Use Restrictions in accordance with clause 3.2.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Investor acknowledges and agrees that:

    i.  neither Tokens nor this Agreement are a financial product as defined in Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act; and

    ii. no entity is required to issue Tokens to the Investor where doing so would give rise to disclosure requirements under Chapter 6D or Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act.

Use Restrictions

(a) All Tokens (including Allocated Tokens) issued to the Investor under this Agreement will be subject to the Use Restrictions.

(b) The Tokens issued to the Investor shall vest and cease to be subject to the Use Restrictions in equal portions at the end of each quarter during the Vesting Period. For clarity, all Tokens issued under this Agreement shall be fully vested and cease to be subject to the Use Restrictions at the end of the Vesting Period.

No rights attached to Tokens

(a) Unless explicitly stated in a Token Sale Agreement or any other agreement relating to the issuance of Tokens, the Investor expressly acknowledges that you are aware that a Token does not provide you with any rights, including:

    i.  any ownership right, interest, share (or equivalent right) in the Company, Token Affiliate, or any other company;

    ii. any right or future right to receive an interest in any intellectual property rights relating to the Company, any other company or the Tokens;

    iii. any right to demand that the Company, Token Affiliate or any of its related bodies corporate purchase or otherwise acquire Tokens from you;

    iv. any other form of participation in or relating to the Company or Token Affiliate; or

    v.  any other right that may be implied by law.

Representations and warranties

Investor representations and warranties

(a) The Investor represents and warrants that:

    i.  if the Investor is an individual, you are of the full age of majority in the jurisdiction in which any Tokens are purchased and are legally competent to enter into such a transaction, to perform all of your obligations under this Agreement, and are to undertake all actions required in accordance with this Agreement;

    ii. if the Investor is not an individual, you have the requisite power, authority, legal capacity and competence to purchase Tokens, to perform all of your obligations under this Agreement, and all necessary approvals of your directors, partners, shareholders, trustees or otherwise with respect to such matters have been given or obtained;
