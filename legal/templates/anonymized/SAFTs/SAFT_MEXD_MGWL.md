RISK DISCLOSURE

1 The MultiBank Group is not a registered broker, analyst or investment advisor. Everything that the MultiBank Group provides is purely for guidance and informational purposes. The Tokens are for purchase as entry into an experimental proof-of-concept ecosystem as defined within the documentation provided by the MultiBank Group which informs the reader about the MultiBank Group's methodologies and practices in relation to the SAFT Offering (the “Official Documentation”). This SAFT and all information relating to this SAFT should be independently verified and confirmed. The MultiBank Group does not accept any liability for any loss or damage whatsoever caused in reliance upon such information or services.

2 All forms of participation in cryptocurrencies involve a substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for every Purchaser. By participating in this SAFT, the Purchaser is subject to risk, which it accepts. There is also no guarantee that the MultiBank Group's goals or objectives will be achieved. The development or deployment of the Token may fail, be abandoned or be delayed for a number of reasons, including lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects, or lack of use by advertisers, publishers, and/or users.

3 The Token is not collateralised and has no intrinsic value. The Purchaser should be aware that they may not recover their Purchase Amount. Please be aware of the risks involved with any digital currency, including the Token. Do not participate with money that you cannot afford to lose. When in doubt, you should consult a qualified financial advisor before making any related financial decisions. Only participate with risk capital; that is, participate with money that, if lost, will not adversely impact your lifestyle and your ability to meet your financial obligations.

4 The MultiBank Group plans on implementing security measures; however, the MultiBank Group cannot predict the success of any security precautions. The MultiBank Group may lose access to its private keys or be subject to data breach or data loss.

5 The full functionality of the Tokens is not yet complete, and no assurance can be provided of such completion. The functionality of the Tokens is complex, will require enhancements and product support over time, and full functionality may take longer than expected.

6 The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees to the following potential risk factors which may halt all operations of the MultiBank Group and/or the Token:

(a) Neither the MultiBank Group, nor any related third party, provides any guarantee as to the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of the information and materials found within this SAFT.

(b) Cryptocurrencies are the subject of regulatory scrutiny by government authorities and other regulatory bodies worldwide, and the MultiBank Group could be adversely affected by one or more enquiries or actions.

(c) Expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Tokens which the Purchaser holds (whether due to the Official Documentation or otherwise), may not be met upon release of the Tokens for any number of reasons, including a change in the design and implementation plans, or delays or differences upon execution.

(d) The blockchains which the MultiBank Group utilise are still in the relatively early stage of development and is not completely proven. Any malfunction, flaws, breakdown or abandonment of such blockchains may have a material adverse effect on the Tokens.

(e) Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, may present risks to cryptocurrencies and the MultiBank Group, which could result in the theft or loss of Tokens.

(f) Human Error: Token transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the processing power on the relevant blockchain. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of Tokens or a theft of Tokens generally will not be reversible, and there may be no compensation for any such transfer or theft. Such loss could adversely affect the value of Tokens. The Purchaser accepts all risks associated.

7 The Token is not an investment product; it is a utility token for the MultiBank Group speculative ecosystem.

8 Any content in the Official Documentation or MultiBank Group website or otherwise disseminated to the Purchaser should not be relied upon as advice or construed as providing recommendations of any kind.

9 Past results are no indication of future performance. In no event should the content of this correspondence be construed as an expressed or implied promise or guarantee.

10 The MultiBank Group is not responsible for any losses incurred as a result of receiving, trading or otherwise using our Token.

11 Information provided in this correspondence is intended solely for informational purposes and is obtained from sources believed to be reliable. Information is in no way guaranteed.

12 No guarantee of any kind is implied or possible where projections of future conditions are attempted.

13 None of the content published here constitutes a recommendation that any particular cryptocurrency, portfolio of cryptocurrencies, transaction or investment strategy is suitable for any specific person. None of the information provided is intended to advise you personally concerning the nature, potential, value or suitability of any particular cryptocurrency, portfolio of cryptocurrencies, transaction, investment strategy or other matter.

14 Market disruptions such as those that occurred during October of 1987 and on [DATE], could have a global material effect on general conditions and market liquidity which could result in substantial losses and potential dissolution of the MultiBank Group.

15 Nothing herein is or should be construed as financial, legal or tax advice to any prospective Purchaser. Each Prospective purchaser is strongly urged to consult such person’s personal tax advisor with respect to the income tax consequences of engaging in this SAFT.

16 Under these terms, the Company and the Tokens may fundamentally change as circumstance development as the Company adjusts.

17 The MultiBank Group is not insured by any government or private insurer. Therefore, in the event of a Dissolution Event, the Purchaser may be unable to recover all or any of their Purchase Amounts.

18 The Tokens may only be purchased in jurisdictions in which their marketing, legality, holding, and distribution are authorised, and any violation of the jurisdictional, in any way, is the Purchaser's responsibility.

Accordingly, the Purchaser should not sign this SAFT unless willing to entrust all aspects of management to the MultiBank Group. The Purchaser will have no right or power to take part in the management or direction of the MultiBank Group.
