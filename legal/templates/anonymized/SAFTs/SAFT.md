[Note: this Schedule contains a large number of risk disclosures which may be amended depending on negotiations and Company’s instructions. Note that this is drafted to be very Company friendly.]

Schedule 2 – Risk Disclosures

1.  Entering into a SAFT involves a high degree of risk. Prospective purchasers should consider carefully the risks described herein, together with all of the other information contained in this agreement and the Information Materials before making a decision to enter into a SAFT. The following risks entail circumstances under which, the business, financial condition, results or operations and prospects of the issuer group could suffer. The following is not an exhaustive list and does not necessarily reflect the relative importance of the various risks factors. The Company does not own, operate or control the Platform or the Platform Operator.

2.  Otherwise than as expressly set out herein, the Company specifically does not represent and warrant and expressly disclaims any representation or warranty with respect to the information materials, the Platform and the Tokens, express, implied or statutory, including without limitation, any representations or warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, usage, suitability or fitness for any particular purpose, or as to the workmanship or technical coding thereof, or the absence of any defects therein, whether latent or patent. The Company does not represent or warrant that Tokens or the Platform are reliable, current or error-free, meet your requirements, or that defects in the Tokens or the Platform will be corrected. The Company cannot and does not represent or warrant that Tokens, the Platform or the delivery mechanism the for Tokens is free of viruses or other harmful components.

3.  A significant amount of further work is required in order for the Company to generate the Tokens and for the Platform Operator to implement the Platform and much of that work is subject to regulatory approval and otherwise reliant on the input or consent of other persons not under the control of the Company or, as relevant, the Platform Operator. The success of the Tokens and the Platform is reliant upon the Company, the Platform Operator and their respective Affiliates (i) securing (as relevant) regulatory approval for the creation of the Tokens; (ii) securing regulatory approval (as relevant) for the launch of the Platform; (iii) raising sufficient resources to fund the ongoing development of the Tokens and the Platform; and (iv) complying with ongoing funding, reserve and/or regulatory requirements (as relevant) related to the proposed creation and operation of the Tokens and the Platform (collectively, the Regulatory and Funding Requirements).

4.  There is a significant risk that the Tokens and the Platform do not develop as envisaged herein. The Information Materials reflect the Company’s current intention with respect to the development of the Tokens and the Platform, including as to such matters as the scale and scope of the envisaged activities, the jurisdictions in which the various operations will be based, the jurisdictions in which they may operate and the jurisdictions in which their customers are based. The Company, in the sole and absolute discretion of the board of directors, reserves the right to modify, extend, reduce, eliminate, add and/or substitute the scale, scope, business lines, operations and any other characteristics of the Tokens and the Platform in order to address any actual or perceived commercial, legal, regulatory or other matters that the Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, considers relevant at any time.

5.  The Company may issue Tokens even if there are material changes to the scale, scope, business lines, operations and any other characteristics of the Tokens and/or the Platform or if the Company or its Affiliates have not satisfied (or are unlikely to satisfy) any Regulatory and Funding Requirements or any other regulatory, commercial or legal requirements with respect to the Tokens and/or the Platform. No promises of future performance or value are or will be made with respect to the Tokens, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that the Tokens will hold any particular value.

6.  The Company is developing the Tokens to be used with respect to the Platform. Upon the TGE the Company will covenant with holders of Tokens to procure that the Platform Operator will accept their duly presented Tokens in exchange for privileges and other benefits related to such Tokens from time to time on the Platform.

7.  The precise terms of the privileges and other benefits of the Tokens will be determined by the Platform Operator in its sole and absolute discretion from time to time. Such privileges and benefits will initially be determined by the Platform Operator on or around the TGE and may be amended thereafter by the Platform Operator at any time and without notice to, or consent from, any holder of Tokens, or the Company, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Platform Operator. Any such determination or amendment shall not be a breach of the terms of the SAFTs or the Tokens.

8.  The Platform, while not owned, operated, developed or otherwise controlled by the Company, is in beta stage, which means that the Platform and all related software are experimental. The Platform is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the Platform is free of defects, vulnerabilities, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. Any use of the Platform shall be at your own risk. In no event shall the Company or the owner of the Platform be held liable in connection with or for any claims, losses, damages or other liabilities, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with the Platform or its operation or use or be under any obligation to support, develop or otherwise maintain or promote the use of the Platform or the integration of the Tokens into the Platform.

9.  While the Tokens are available only to purchasers that are not Prohibited Persons there is the possibility that Tokens could be acquired over time or following changes in the regulatory landscape by persons in other jurisdictions currently restricted from acquiring Tokens and, accordingly, the risk factors set out below may include certain risk factors specific to certain jurisdictions even though the Company will not at present make the Tokens available at this time to persons from such jurisdictions.

10. By participating in any acquisition of tokens, you expressly acknowledge and assume all risks related thereto including (without limitation) the risks set out below:

(a) No guarantee that Tokens will be released: The Company is issuing the SAFTs in part to facilitate the ongoing development of the Tokens. Many factors could influence the success of the Company in developing the Tokens, some of which are out of the Company’s control, and there can be no guarantee that the Company will ultimately be successful in deploying and delivering the Tokens. The Company may change its plans for issuing the Tokens for a variety of reasons, including a change in business plan, technological challenges, lack of perceived demand, or other reasons. Finally, if the Company ceases operations, agrees to assign its assets and liabilities to a third party for the benefit of creditors in the case of insolvency, or engages in a liquidation or winding up, it may never issue the Tokens. If the TGE does not occur or for other reasons the Company does not issue the Tokens as planned, investors will not receive some or all of their Tokens. The Company has sole discretion to determine when, or if, the TGE occurs.

(b) No guarantee on when or if the TGE will occur: There are no guarantees as to the timing (if ever) of the TGE or the release of the Platform, each of which is dependent on many factors, including many outside the Company’s control. If the TGE does not occur by the Deadline Date then the SAFTs will terminate in accordance with the provisions set out in each SAFT.

(c) Reliance on one or more Developers: The Company may enter into one or more services agreements pursuant to which one or more software developers (each a Developer) will provide services with respect to the Company’s development and sale of the Tokens. As consideration for each such Developer providing those services, the Company may agree to issue the Developer with a significant number of Tokens. The Director of the Company believes that the provisions of each such software development agreement will reflect commercial arms-length dealings between the Company and each such Developer although there is a material risk that the Tokens are never created, or are never suitably integrated into the Platform, in the event that the Company is unable to retain suitable Developers for an ongoing period of time.

(d) Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Wallet Incompatibility: Your cryptocurrency wallet must possess technical infrastructure that is compatible with the receipt, storage and transfer of the Tokens. Non-compatible wallet addresses will not be accepted. In addition, your wallet address must not be associated with a third party exchange or service that has custody over the private key. You must own the private key if your address is an exchange address. The Company reserves the right to prescribe additional conditions relating to specific wallet requirements at any time, acting in its sole discretion.

(e) Risks Associated with the Blockchain Protocols: Any malfunction, breakdown, abandonment, unintended function, unexpected functioning of or attack on the protocol upon which the Tokens are issued may have an adverse effect on the Tokens, including causing them to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner.

(f) Risks Associated with Your Credentials: Any third party that gains access to or learns of your wallet login credentials or private keys may be able to dispose of your Tokens. To minimize this risk, you should guard against unauthorized access to your electronic devices. Best practices dictate that you safely store private keys in one or more backup locations geographically separated from the working location. In addition, you are responsible for giving us the correct wallet address to which to send your Tokens. If you give us the incorrect address to which to send your Tokens, we are not responsible for any loss of Tokens that may occur.

(g) Risk of unfavourable regulatory action in one or more Jurisdictions:

(i) Blockchain technologies and cryptographic tokens have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. Blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which regulations may be contrary to the current setup of the Platform or its smart contract system and, therefore, may result in substantial modifications to the Platform and such smart contract systems, including its termination and the loss of Tokens.

(ii) The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory authorities may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including specifically (but without limitation to) the Platform and Tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any legislative or regulatory authorities may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including specifically (but without limitation to) the Platform and Tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Platform and Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that Tokens are a regulated financial instrument that requires registration, licensing or restriction. The Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction if regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. The functioning of the Platform and the Tokens could be impacted by any regulatory inquiries or actions, including restrictions on the use, sale or possession of digital tokens like the Tokens, which restrictions could impede, limit or end the development of the Platform and increase legal costs.

(iii) The cryptocurrency exchange market, the token listing and trading market, initial coin offerings, and by extension the Platform, is subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to “know you customer” and “anti-money laundering” and customer due diligence procedures, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, data security, and others. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting the Platform could be enacted, which could impact the utility of the Tokens in the Platform. Additionally, users of the Platform are subject to or may be adversely affected by industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, it could adversely impact the Platform and the Tokens, including the utility of Tokens with respect to the Platform.

(iv) The Company may need to obtain approvals from one or more Governmental Authorities and there is a risk that securing such approvals may delay or prevent the TGE, the development of the Platform and/or the Company’s ability to issue the Tokens.

(h) Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Platforms: Following the issue of the Tokens and the continued development of the Platform, it is possible that alternative applications or platforms could be established, which use the same or similar open source code and protocol underlying the Platform. The Tokens may have no intrinsic value with respect to such alternative applications. The Platform may compete with these alternative, unofficial token-based applications, which could potentially negatively impact the Platform and the Tokens.

(i) TGE Risk and Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Platform: There are no guarantees as to the timing of the Tokens being generated or the release of the Platform, each of which is dependent on many factors, including many outside the Company’s control. The Platform may not be owned, operated or controlled by the Company. Further, it is possible that the Platform will not be used by a large number of businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the Platform. Such a lack of interest could negatively impact the Tokens and the Platform.

(j) Operating History: The Company has no operating history and will be operating in an evolving industry that may not develop as expected. A significant amount of further work is required in order to create the Tokens by the Company and implement the Platform by the Platform Operator and much of that work is reliant on the input or consent of other persons not under the control of the Company. Assessing the business and future prospects of the Company and the Platform Operator is challenging in light of the risks and difficulties the Company and the Platform Operator may encounter. These risks and difficulties include, but are not limited to, their ability to:

(i) navigate complex and evolving regulatory and competitive environments;

(ii) obtain the requisite regulatory and other licenses in the relevant jurisdictions;

(iii) obtain and retain customers;

(iv) successfully develop, maintain and update internal controls to manage compliance within an evolving and complex regulatory environment;

(v) effectively identify and react to market trends;

(vi) be involved in the successful development and deployment of the Platform;

(vii) implement new products and services;

(viii) successfully execute the Company’s funding strategy;

(ix) effectively compete with other companies;

(x) successfully navigate economic conditions and fluctuations in the market;

(xi) effectively manage the growth of the business;

(xii) continue to develop, maintain and scale the Platform;

(xiii) effectively use finite personnel and technology resources;

(xiv) effectively maintain and scale financial and risk management controls and procedures;

(xv) maintain the security of technology infrastructure, and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized therein; and

(xvi) attract, integrate and retain qualified employees and contractors.

(k) Risk that the Platform, if ever Developed, Will Not Meet Expectations: The Platform presently is under continued development by the Platform Operator and may undergo significant changes. Any expectations or assumptions regarding the form and functionality of the Platform or the Tokens (including participant behaviour) held by the owner of the Platform, the Company or you may not be met, for any number of reasons, including, without limitation, mistaken assumptions or analysis, a change in the design and implementation plans, and changes in the execution of the Platform. Moreover, the Company may not be able to retain full and effective control over how other participants will use the Platform, what products or services will be offered through the Platform by third parties, or how third-party products and services will utilize Tokens (if at all). This could create the risk that the Tokens or Platform, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to assist the owner of the Platform to develop and participate in the Platform, it is still possible that the Platform will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately maintained, which may negatively impact the Platform and Tokens, and the potential utility of the Tokens.

(l) The terms and characteristics of the Tokens can change prior to the TGE: The Company is issuing the SAFTs before the Tokens are fully developed. As is normal and expected in such a development stage, the Company may be prevented from developing the Tokens in the form contemplated at the time a SAFT was executed. Accordingly, the terms and conditions of the Tokens, and how they may operate with respect to the Platform, may be substantially different at the time of the TGE.

(m) A SAFT is not the same as a Token: Purchasing a SAFT does not provide an investor any Tokens. It only provides investors with the right to receive Tokens pursuant to the terms described in the SAFT and Information Materials. Investors should be prepared to hold on to their SAFTs and not receive Tokens for an extended period of time.

(n) The value of the Tokens will be affected by the success of the Platform: Because the Tokens are intended for use on the Platform, a failure by the Platform Operator to successfully develop and/or maintain the Platform would negatively affect the value of the Tokens. There is no guarantee that the Platform will develop as planned or become successful in the marketplace.

(o) Long-term viability of crypto assets: Crypto assets, including those like the Tokens, are a new and relatively untested product. There is considerable uncertainty about their long-term viability, which could be affected by a variety of factors, including many market-based factors such as economic growth, inflation, and others. In addition, the success of crypto assets (including the Tokens) will depend on the long-term utility and economic viability of blockchain and other new technologies related to crypto assets. Due in part to these uncertainties, the price of crypto assets are volatile and the Tokens may be hard to sell. The Company does not control any of these factors, and therefore may not be able to control the ability of the Tokens to maintain their value over time.

(p) Further innovations in the crypto asset industry may cause the Tokens to lose value: The development and acceptance of the cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of, and transactions in, crypto assets is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate and predict. The use of crypto assets to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services is part of a new and rapidly evolving commercial practice that employs digital assets based on a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. The growth of this commercial practice in general, and the use of crypto assets in particular, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Factors affecting further development of the crypto asset industry include, among other things, the continued worldwide adoption of crypto assets; governmental and quasi-governmental regulation of crypto assets and/or crypto asset exchanges; changing consumer demographics, tastes and preferences; sustained development and maintenance of open-source software protocols; the popularity and availability of alternative and/or new payment services; and general economic conditions. If these factors negatively affect or impede the development of the crypto asset industry, the value of an investor’s Investment in a SAFT or holding of Tokens may also be negatively affected.

(q) Inability to Fund Development or Maintenance: The Company may not be able to fund development of the Tokens while the owner of the Platform may not be able to develop or maintain the Platform in the manner that it was intended.

(r) Risks from Taxation: The tax characterization of the Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with acquiring and holding Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting requirements. An investment pursuant to the SAFT and the purchase of Tokens pursuant thereto may result in adverse tax consequences to Investors, including withholding taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting requirements. Additionally, subsequent transactions in crypto assets such as the Tokens may cause investors to incur tax liabilities. Further, any reward received in the form of, or through the use of, Tokens may result in additional tax liability. Each investor should consult with and must rely upon the advice of its own professional tax advisors.

(s) Risk of Theft and Hacking:

(i) Smart contracts, software applications and the Platform may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals, groups, organizations or countries that interfere with the Platform or the availability of the Tokens in any number of ways, including denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks, or phishing, or other novel methods that may or may not be known. Any such successful attacks could result in theft or loss of Tokens, adversely impacting the ability to further develop the Platform and/or related Platforms and derive any usage or functionality from Tokens. You must take appropriate steps to satisfy yourself of the integrity and veracity of relevant websites, systems and communications. Furthermore, because the Platform is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company’s team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or defects into the core infrastructure of the Platform, which could negatively affect the Platform and Tokens.

(ii) You acknowledge, understand and accept that if your private key or password gets lost or stolen, the Tokens associated with your wallet address may be unrecoverable and permanently lost. Additionally, any third party that gains access to your private key, including by gaining access to the login credentials relating to your wallet, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your Tokens, for which the Company shall have no liability.

(t) Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Platform: The Platform consists, at least in part, of open source software that may be based on other open source software. There is a risk that the Company or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Platform interfering with the use of or causing the loss of Tokens.

(u) Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography: Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Platform by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Platform, which could result in the theft, loss or decreased utility of the Tokens. Smart contracts, blockchain application software and blockchain platforms and protocols are still in an early development stage and relatively unproven. There is no warranty or assurance that the process for creating Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software could contain defects, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, viruses or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of contributions and/or Tokens.

(v) Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the Platform: While the Tokens should not be viewed as an investment, they may have value over time. That value may be limited or non-existent if the Platform lacks acceptance, use and adoption, which may have an adverse impact on the Tokens.

(w) Risk of an Illiquid Market for Tokens: There may never be any marketplace for Tokens. There are currently no exchanges upon which the Tokens would trade. If exchanges do develop, they will likely be relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight. They may, therefore, be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges for other products and have a negative impact on the Tokens. To the extent that any third party ascribes an external exchange value to Tokens (e.g. as denominated in a crypto or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero. If (despite your representations to us to the contrary) you are holding Tokens as a form of investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, or for a financial purpose, with the expectation or desire that their inherent, intrinsic or cash-equivalent value may increase with time, you assume all risks associated with such speculation or actions, and any errors associated therewith, and accept that the Tokens are not offered by the Company or its affiliates on an investment basis.

(x) Risk of Dissolution of the Platform: It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including development issues with the Platform, the failure of business relationships, lack of public interest, lack of funding, or competing intellectual property claims, the Platform may no longer be viable as a business or otherwise and may dissolve or fail to maintain commercial or legal viability, or be abandoned. There is no assurance that you will receive any benefits through the Tokens.

(y) Risk of Malfunction in the Platform: It is possible that the Platform malfunctions in an unfavourable way, including one that results in the loss of the Tokens.

(z) Risk Arising from Lack of Governance Rights: Because the Tokens confer only limited governance rights with respect to the Platform; all decisions involving the Company (including to sell or liquidate the Company) will be made by the Company acting in its sole and absolute discretion, and substantially all decisions involving the Platform including, but not limited to, decisions by the Platform Operator to discontinue the Platform, will be made by the Platform Operator acting in its sole and absolute discretion. These decisions could adversely affect the Platform and/or Tokens you hold.

(a) Risks Associated with Incomplete Information regarding the Tokens and the Platform: You will not have full access to all the information relevant to the Company, the Tokens and/or the Platform. Neither the Company nor the Platform Operator is required to update you on the progress of the Platform. You are responsible for making your own decision in respect of the acquisition of the Tokens. The Company does not provide you with any recommendation or advice in respect of the acquisition of the Tokens. You may not rely on the Company to provide you with complete or up to date information.

(b) The holders of Tokens will not be in any fiduciary, partnership, trustee, agency or similar relationship with the Company or any of its affiliates and will not be owed any fiduciary duty by the Company or any of its affiliates. The holders of Tokens have no direct management, equity, voting or similar rights in the Company or any of its affiliates. However, without limitation to the above, the Company reserves all rights with respect to pursuing any form of decentralized governance should it so determine that doing so would be in the best interests of the holders of Tokens from time to time.

(c) In order to seek compliance with (or to seek to mitigate the impact of) any laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, judgments, injunctions, orders, treaties, administrative acts or decrees of any nation or government, any state or other political subdivision thereof, any entity exercising legislative, judicial or administrative functions of or pertaining to government, including, without limitation, any government authority, agency, department, board, commission or instrumentality, and any court, tribunal or arbitrator(s) of competent jurisdiction, and any self-regulatory organization believed by the Company or its affiliates to apply to or affect the Company or its affiliates, the Platform or the Tokens, the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion take such steps as it considers necessary or convenient to comply with such matters including, without limitation, the termination of the Tokens and/or the Platform. In addition, the Company may take such steps as it considers necessary or convenient where it believes or suspects the Tokens may be used, trafficked or applied in the attempted furtherance of money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion or other unlawful activity or where it believes the Platform is no longer viable.

(d) Regulation of (i) tokens (including the Tokens); (ii) cryptocurrencies (iii) blockchain technologies; and (iv) cryptocurrency exchanges is currently underdeveloped and is likely to evolve rapidly, vary significantly among international, national, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States, South Korea, China, Singapore, among other countries, are currently considering, or may in the future consider, laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact the development and growth of the Platform, the Company and the Tokens. Other countries may adopt similar approaches. Failure by the Company or users of the Platform to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines. New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations would likely have numerous material adverse consequences on the Company and the Tokens. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any new or continuing regulatory scrutiny or initiatives will not have a material adverse impact on the value of the Tokens or impede the activities of the Company.

(e) Use of Proceeds. Management expects to use the net proceeds from this offering to advance further the development of the Tokens and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Management may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire, license and invest in complementary products, technologies or businesses; however, the Company currently has no agreements or commitments to complete any such transaction. However, management will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from the SAFTs, and could spend the proceeds from the SAFT offering in ways with which investors may not agree with or that do not yield a favourable return, if at all. If management does not invest or apply the proceeds of this offering in ways that benefit the Tokens, the future value and utility of investors’ Tokens may be adversely affected.

(f) The Company has the exclusive right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to address and remediate any of the operational, legal or regulatory risks presented as of the date hereof or hereafter. In the exercise of such rights, it is possible that the Company may determine that the continued development of the Platform is not feasible. Accordingly, there is a material risk that the Company and its affiliates may not successfully continue to develop, market and operate the Platform and the Tokens.

(g) Prohibition on U.S. resales. Tokens issued to non-U.S. Persons are being offered and sold in compliance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act, which generally prohibits transfers to U.S. Persons for a period of one year from the completion of the Offering. In addition, the Company does not intend to facilitate a market for the Tokens in the U.S. and expects to restrict Token resales to non-U.S. Persons and exchanges that do not permit participation by U.S. Persons for an indefinite period.

(h) Tokens issued to U.S. Persons are being offered and sold in compliance with Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act, and will be “restricted securities” within the meaning of SEC Rule 144(a)(3) under such Act. Accordingly, they may not be resold except pursuant to registration under the U.S. Securities Act or an available exemption from registration. In this connection, the prospective purchaser represents that it is familiar with SEC Rule 144, as presently in effect, and understands the resale limitations imposed thereby and by the Act.

Unanticipated Risks: Cryptographic tokens are a relatively new and comparatively untested technology. In addition to the risks discussed herein, there are risks that the Company cannot anticipate. Further risks may materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed risks or the emergence of new risks.
[Note: this Schedule contains a large number of Purchaser Warranties which may be amended depending on negotiations and Company’s instructions. Note that this is drafted to be very Company friendly.]

Schedule 3 – Purchaser’s Warranties

The Purchaser represents, warrants, and agrees with each of the Company and its Affiliates that:

a.  the Purchaser is not a Prohibited Person

b.  The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser is solely and entirely responsible for ensuring that the Purchaser can legally purchase the Purchased Tokens in accordance with the laws of the Purchaser’s home or applicable jurisdiction and that the Purchaser does not purchase any Purchased Tokens if the Purchaser is not able to legally do so under the laws of the Purchaser’s applicable jurisdiction. The Purchaser certifies that it has full legal capacity, power, and authority to execute and deliver this agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. The Purchaser acknowledges that agreement constitutes valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity.

c.  The Purchaser will complete any necessary Know Your Customer (KYC) due diligence that the Company requires to ascertain that the funds used for the purchases of the Purchased Tokens are not from illicit sources. The Purchaser affirms that they have conducted appropriate due diligence on the source of funds used in the purchase of the Purchased Tokens and have a suitable anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) framework in place. The Purchaser will indemnify the Company for any damages arising from breaches in AML & CFT laws or policies. If the Purchaser is unable to provide to the Company, adequate information on the source of funds or compliance with AML & CFT laws or policies, the Company has full discretion to render this agreement void and refund any payment by the Purchaser.

d.  The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser is solely and entirely responsible for ensuring that the Company’s Wallet Address provided by the Purchaser for the receipt of the Purchased Tokens is able to receive and hold the Purchased Tokens. The Purchaser agrees that they will not hold the Company responsible in any way for any addresses or wallets supplied by the Purchaser that cannot receive the Purchased Tokens, or which are faulty or non-functional for the purposes of receiving the Purchased Tokens in the course of the anticipated Token Sale. The Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser is solely and entirely responsible for security relating to the private key for the digital wallet address which will be used to hold the Purchased Tokens purchased pursuant to the provisions herein. The Purchaser agrees that they will not hold the Company liable for loss or security breach of the relevant private key and understands that if the relevant private key is breached, stolen, hacked, or otherwise made inaccessible to the Purchaser, that the Purchased Tokens purchased will consequently be rendered permanently irretrievable.

e.  The execution, delivery and performance of this agreement shall not result in any violation of, be in conflict with, or constitute a material default under, with or without the passage of time or the giving of notice of:

(i) any provision of the Purchaser’s organizational documents, if applicable;

     b.  the Purchaser hereby represents that:

     i.  it has satisfied itself as to the full observance of applicable Law in connection with its entry into this agreement, including the legal requirements within its jurisdiction for the entry into this agreement and the acquisition of the Tokens, any foreign exchange restrictions applicable to such purchase or exchange, and any Governmental Authority or other consents that may need to be obtained;

     ii. the Purchaser has consulted with, and is relying solely upon the advice of, its own advisors relating to the income tax and other tax consequences, if any, that may be relevant to the purchase, holding, exchange, sale or transfer of, as relevant, this agreement and the Tokens; and

     iii. the Purchaser’s subscription and payment for this agreement, continued beneficial ownership of this agreement, exchange for Tokens or continued beneficial ownership of the Tokens will not violate any applicable securities or other Laws of the Purchaser’s jurisdiction.

          a.  The Purchaser hereby has sufficient knowledge and experience in business and financial matters to be able to evaluate the risks and merits of its purchase of this agreement and of the Purchased Tokens and is able to bear the risks thereof. The Purchaser is aware of Company’s business affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire this agreement. The Purchaser understands that the Purchased Tokens involve risks, all of which the Purchaser fully and completely assumes, including, but not limited to, the risk that:

     b.  The Purchaser understands and expressly accepts that the Purchased Tokens will be created and delivered to the Purchaser at the sole risk of the Purchaser on an “AS IS” and “UNDER DEVELOPMENT” basis. The Purchaser understands and expressly accepts that the Purchaser has not relied on any representations or warranties made by the Company outside of this agreement, including, but not limited to, conversations of any kind, whether through oral or electronic communication, or any white paper. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by law, the Purchaser assumes all risk and liability for the results obtained by the use of any assets and regardless of any oral or written statements made by the Company, by way of technical advice or otherwise, related to the use of the assets.

     c.  With respect to the Information Materials, the Platform, this agreement and the Tokens, the Company specifically does not represent and warrant and expressly disclaims any representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, including without limitation, any representations or warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, usage, suitability or fitness for any particular purpose, or as to the workmanship or technical coding thereof, or the absence of any defects therein, whether latent or patent.

The Company cannot and does not represent or warrant that Tokens or the delivery mechanism the for Tokens is free of viruses or other harmful components.

     d.  The representations and warranties of the Purchaser contained in this agreement and any other instrument provided by the purchaser to the Company in connection herewith are true, accurate and not misleading as of the date of this agreement or such instrument, as relevant, and shall be deemed to have reaffirmed on all such other dates as the Purchaser continues to hold any Tokens.

     e.  The Purchaser assumes all risk and liability for the results obtained by the use of any Tokens and regardless of any oral or written statements made by the Company or any other person, by way of technical advice or otherwise, related to the use of the Tokens.

     f.  the Purchaser will not acquire and will not transfer any Tokens within or engage (except as specifically authorized by the Company) in any activity relating to the sale, distribution or any other use of Tokens in any jurisdiction identified in Schedule 4 of this agreement.

     g.  the Purchaser will not transfer, directly or indirectly, any Tokens acquired hereunder to any Prohibited Person or any person or entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with such a person.

     h.  the Company and its Affiliates retain all right, title and interest in all of their intellectual property, including, without limitation, inventions, ideas, concepts, code, discoveries, processes, marks, methods, software, compositions, formulas, techniques, information and data, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or protectable in trademark, and any trademarks, copyright or patents based thereon. The Purchaser has no right to claim as a holder of Tokens any intellectual property rights, functionality or equivalent rights or any other form of participation in, or relating to, the Platform and/or anything in relation to the Company and its Affliates.

     i.  the Purchase Amount is not derived from or related to any unlawful activities, including, without limitation, money laundering or terrorist financing, and that the Purchaser shall not use the Tokens to finance, engage in, or otherwise support any unlawful activities, and all payments shall be made only in the Purchaser’s name from a digital wallet or bank account not located in a restricted territory identified in Schedule 4 of this agreement, as may be amended by the Company from time to time. Any breach of this clause (p) of this Schedule 3 or failure to comply with this clause (p) of this Schedule 4 (determined at the sole and absolute discretion of the Company) shall give the Company the right to refuse:

(i) any application made by the Purchaser for Tokens, and

(ii) the transfer, or further transfer, of any Tokens to the Purchaser.

     a.  the Company may run any check or enquiry with any third-party providers and the Purchaser waives any privacy or other related rights and acknowledge that any breach of this representation by the Purchaser shall entitle the Company to terminate this agreement with immediate effect, including, without limitation, and in addition to any other action the Company may take, the restriction of access to the Tokens and/or the Platform.

     b.  the use of the Tokens, the development of the Platform by its owner and the Company’s operations may cease in one or more jurisdictions in the event that the actions of any Governmental Authority or changes of Laws make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so.

     c.  although the Tokens may be tradeable, they are not, and in no case may be understood, deemed, interpreted or construed to be or to be representative of, any kind of:

(i) currency, legal tender, means of payment, money or deposit, whether fiat or otherwise, nor any substitute for such currency, legal tender, money or deposit;

(ii) investment (whether secured or unsecured), equity interest, proprietary interest, economic right (including any kind of right to payment, income, dividend, profit, or other return, or any sums to be paid, or likely to be paid, out of such), share or similar interest in or claim against any person, asset, entity, organization, scheme, venture or project (including the Company or any other Affiliate);

(iii) equity, debt or hybrid instrument, security, collective investment scheme, managed fund, financial derivative, futures contract, deposit, commercial paper, negotiable instrument, investment contract, note, bond, warrant, certificate or instrument entitling the holder to interest, dividends or any kind of return, nor any other financial instrument;

(iv) right, title, interest or benefit whatsoever in whole or in part, in Company or any other Company and its Affiliates or any assets related to them, other than the right to use the Tokens as a means to enable usage of, and interaction with and within, the Platform if successfully completed and deployed; or

(v) any commodity that any person is obliged to redeem or purchase.

    a.  any Token terms and conditions, as issued by the Company from time to time (the Token Terms and Conditions) shall apply with respect to the Tokens transferred hereunder and that in the event of any inconsistency between this agreement and the Token Terms and Conditions, this agreement shall prevail to the extent of any such inconsistency.

    b.  the Token Terms and Conditions may be varied at any time by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion and that all such variations that are notified to the Purchaser by the Company in writing shall apply as if expressly incorporated into this agreement, the necessary changes having been made.

    c.  the Purchaser’s participation pursuant to this agreement is distinct from a sale of Tokens by the Company governed only by the Token Terms and Conditions insofar as certain provisions of the Token Terms and Conditions may be amended as specified herein, but otherwise all other provisions of the Token Terms and Conditions apply to the Purchaser as a buyer of Tokens.

    d.  when the Purchaser (or any of the Purchaser’s designated agents) clicks on an “I Agree,” “I Consent,” or other similarly worded button or entry field whereby my mouse, keystroke or other device, the Purchaser’s agreement or consent will be legally binding and enforceable against the Purchaser and will be the legal equivalent of the Purchaser’s (or any of the Purchaser’s designated agents) handwritten signature on an agreement that is printed on paper.

    e.  this agreement is in all respects intended by each party hereto to be deemed and construed to have been jointly prepared by the parties and the parties hereby expressly agree that any uncertainty or ambiguity existing herein shall not be interpreted against either of them.
