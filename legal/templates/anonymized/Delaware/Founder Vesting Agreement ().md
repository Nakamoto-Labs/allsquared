FOUNDER’S VESTING AGREEMENT

This Founder’s Vesting Agreement (this “Agreement”) is made on July [XX], 2025 by and between [PARTY], a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and [Insert Founder Name] (“Founder”).

WHEREAS, Founder holds [200,000] shares of the Common Stock of the Company (the “Founder Shares”).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration for the mutual promises and covenants set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1.      Unvested Share Repurchase Option. Upon the termination of the Founder’s service to the Company as an employee or consultant, for any reason, or no reason, with or without Cause, including Involuntary Termination, death or temporary or permanent disability, the Company shall have a right (but not an obligation) (the “Unvested Share Repurchase Option”) to repurchase any shares of Stock to the extent they have not vested pursuant to subsections 1(a) and (b) (“Unvested Shares”) under the terms set forth below.

(a)      Vesting of Unvested Shares. Seventy five percent (100%) of the Founder Shares initially shall be Unvested Shares. Twenty five percent (25%) of the Unvested Shares shall vest immediately on the anniversary of date of this Agreement (being July [XX], 2026); and 1/24 of the initial number of Unvested Shares shall vest on [DATE]; and 1/24 of the initial number of Unvested Shares shall vest on the 15th day of each month thereafter subject to the Founder’s continuous service to the Company as an employee or consultant providing services at least three (3) days per week.

(b)      Acceleration of Vesting. The other provisions of this Section 1 notwithstanding, if there is a Change of Control, the Unvested Shares shall become fully vested immediately prior to the date the Change of Control becomes effective. For purposes of this Agreement:

(i)      “Change of Control” shall mean (i) a merger or consolidation or the sale, or exchange by the stockholders of the Company of all or substantially all of the capital stock of the Company, where the stockholders of the Company immediately before such transaction do not obtain or retain, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the beneficial interest in the voting stock or other voting equity of the surviving or acquiring corporation or other surviving or acquiring entity, in substantially the same proportion as before such transaction, or (ii) the sale or exchange of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets (other than a sale or transfer to a subsidiary of the Company as defined in section 424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) where the stockholders of the Company immediately before such sale or exchange do not obtain or retain, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the beneficial interest in the voting stock or other voting equity of the corporation or other entity acquiring the Company’s assets, in substantially the same proportion as before such transaction;

(ii)      “Cause” shall mean (i) Founder’s violation of any applicable law or regulation with respect to the Company’s business; or (ii) Founder’s commission of a felony or commission of a crime involving moral turpitude; or (iii) conduct by Founder involving wilful misconduct, fraud, gross negligence, or embezzlement with respect to the Company; or (iv) a good faith finding by the Board of Directors of the Company of repeated and wilful failure of the Founder after written notice to perform his assigned duties for the Company, gross negligence or misconduct (where such gross negligence or misconduct is materially adverse to the Company); and

(iii)      “Involuntary Termination” shall mean Founder’s termination of Service with the Company within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of any of the following without Founder’s consent: (i) a material reduction or change in job duties, reporting relationships, responsibilities and requirements inconsistent with Founder’s position with the Company and prior duties, reporting relationships, responsibilities and requirements, provided that neither a mere change in title alone nor reassignment to a position that is substantially similar to the position previously held in terms of job duties, responsibilities or requirements shall constitute a material reduction in job responsibilities; (ii) a reduction in Founder’s then-current base salary by at least 20%, provided that an across-the-board reduction in the salary level of all other senior executives by the same percentage amount as part of a general salary level reduction shall not constitute such a salary reduction or (iii) Founder’s refusal to relocate the principal place for performance of Company duties to a location more than thirty (30) miles from the Company’s then current location.

(c)      Exercise of Unvested Share Repurchase Option. The Company may exercise the Unvested Share Repurchase Option by written notice to Founder or the Founder’s legal representative within sixty (60) days after such termination.

(d)      Payment for Stock and Return of Stock. Payment by the Company to the Founder or the Founder’s legal representative shall be made in cash or by check within sixty (60) days after the date of the mailing of the written notice of exercise of the Unvested Share Repurchase Option. For purposes of the foregoing, cancellation of any promissory note of the Founder to the Company shall be treated as payment to the Founder in cash to the extent of the unpaid principal and any accrued interest cancelled. The purchase price per share for the shares being repurchased by the Company shall be equal to the original purchase price for such shares, as appropriately adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization or the like. Within thirty (30) days after payment by the Company, the Founder shall deliver to the Company for cancellation the shares of Stock that the Company has repurchased. If the Company holds any vested shares in escrow, such shares will be promptly delivered to Founder following the Company’s exercise of its right to repurchase any unvested shares. Upon delivery of notice and payment of the purchase price in any of the ways described above, the Company shall become the legal and beneficial owner of the Shares being repurchased and all rights and interest therein or related thereto, and the Company shall have the right to transfer to its own name the number of Shares being repurchased by the Company, without further action by Founder.

(e)      Transfers Not Subject to the Unvested Share Repurchase Option. The Unvested Share Repurchase Option shall not apply to a transfer to the Founder’s ancestors, descendants or spouse or to a trustee for their benefit or the benefit of the Founder, provided that such transferee agrees in writing (in a form satisfactory to the Company) to take the Stock subject to all the terms and conditions of this Section 1. All transferees of Shares or any interest therein will receive and hold such Shares or interest subject to the provisions of this Agreement. In the event of any purchase by the Company hereunder where the Shares or interest are held by a transferee, the transferee shall be obligated, if requested by the Company, to transfer the Shares or interest to the Founder for consideration equal to the amount to be paid by the Company hereunder. In the event the Repurchase Option is exercised by the Company pursuant to Section 1 hereof, the Company may deem any transferee to have transferred the Shares or interest to Founder prior to their purchase by the Company, and payment of the purchase price by the Company to such transferee shall be deemed to satisfy Founder’s obligation to pay such transferee for such Shares or interest and also to satisfy the Company’s obligation to pay Founder for such Shares or interest. Any sale or transfer of the Shares shall be void unless the provisions of this Agreement are satisfied.

(f)      Legends. The Company may place a legend referencing the Unvested Share Repurchase Option on any certificate representing Stock subject to the Unvested Share Repurchase Option.

2.      Legends. All certificates representing any shares of Stock subject to the provisions of this Agreement shall have endorsed thereon the following legends:

 

(a)      “THE TRANSFER OF THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE RESTRICTED PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE HOLDER OF THESE SHARES, OR HIS OR HER PREDECESSOR IN INTEREST, A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE AT THE Registered Office: [ADDRESS]

(b)      “THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS THERE IS AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER SUCH ACT COVERING SUCH SECURITIES, THE SALE IS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 144 UNDER THE ACT, OR THE COMPANY RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE HOLDER OF THESE SECURITIES REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, STATING THAT SUCH SALE, TRANSFER, ASSIGNMENT OR HYPOTHECATION IS EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH ACT.”

(c)      Any legend required to be placed thereon under applicable state securities laws.

(f)      Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless continue in full force and effect without being impaired or invalidated in any way and shall be construed in accordance with the purposes and tenor and effect of this Agreement.
