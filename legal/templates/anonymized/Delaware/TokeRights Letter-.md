[Insert Investor name]

Re: Token Rights Letter Agreement

Dear [Insert name],

This letter agreement will confirm our agreement that pursuant to and effective as of your purchase of a Simple Agreement for Future Equity dated on or about the date hereof (the “SAFE”) by and between you and [PARTY] (the “Company”), [Insert Investor name] (the “Investor”, “you”, “your”) shall be entitled to the following contractual rights:

1.  Conditional Token Rights.

(a) If the Company or any affiliate, foundation or nominee thereof (a “Token Affiliate”) creates any Tokens (as defined in clause 7), and subject to the conditions set out in clause 2 and applicable law, the Investor will be entitled to its Pro Rata Portion of the aggregate number of such Tokens allocated to the Company’s (or any Token Affiliate’s) employees, officers, directors, advisors, consultants, stockholders or other investors (collectively, “Insiders”) for no additional consideration or nominal consideration (such right, the “Token Right”). Any Tokens issued by the Company or any Token Affiliate to Insiders shall be subject to a minimum one-year lockup period commencing on the public launch of such Token, provided that in no event shall any restrictions on transfer with respect to any Token (“Transfer Restrictions”) [Note: Token Restrictions may be amended to as required.] apply at any time after the fourth anniversary of the public launch of such Token. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such Transfer Restrictions shall apply to the Investor unless all Tokens that are issued (directly or indirectly) to Insiders are subject to Transfer Restrictions at least as onerous as those applicable to the Investor. “Pro Rata Portion” means the ratio of (i) that the aggregate number of shares of capital stock (on an as-converted and as-exercised basis, including the conversion of the SAFE and other Convertible Securities, as applicable) of the Company owned by the Investor and its affiliates bears to (ii) the aggregate number of shares of capital stock (on an as-converted and as-exercised basis, including the conversion of the SAFE and other Convertible Securities, as applicable) of the Company, in each case, as of the date such Tokens are minted, generated or created.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Token Right excludes any (i) Tokens issued or used solely for development, testing or experimental purposes, (ii) Tokens that may be created and issued following the date such Tokens are first issued to non-Insiders (other than any Token Affiliate) pursuant to staking, rewards or inflationary or dilutive controls; provided, that any such Tokens dilute all Tokens equally and (x) are issued in accordance with the governance terms of the protocol and not in the sole discretion of the Company, any Token Affiliate or any Insider, and (y) with respect to any staking or rewards process, the Investor is allowed to participate in any such staking or rewards process on the same basis as other participants (any such Tokens, “Autonomously Generated Tokens”), and (iii) non-fungible Tokens issued in arms’ length transactions in the ordinary course of business; provided that no such disposition shall be to the Company, any Token Affiliate or any Insider unless the Investor is entitled to participate in any such disposition on the same basis as other participants (collectively, “Excluded Tokens”).

2.  Conditions

(a) The issuance of any Tokens under this agreement is subject to the Company’s sole discretion to decide to create and issue any Tokens. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that it has no rights against any entity (including the Company or Token Affiliate) if there no Token is created or issued.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Investor acknowledges and agrees that no entity is required to issue Tokens to the Investor, where doing so would give rise to registration, disclosure or additional regulatory requirements under applicable laws in the Delaware, United States or any other jurisdiction as reasonably determined by the Company.

(c) Unless explicitly stated in any other agreement relating to the issuance of Tokens, the Investor expressly acknowledges that the Investor is aware that a Token does not provide it with any rights, including: (i) any ownership right, interest, share (or equivalent right) in the Company, Token Affiliate or any other company; (ii) any right or future right to receive an interest in any intellectual property rights relating to the Company, the Token Affiliate, any other company or the Tokens; (iii) any right to demand that the Company, Token Affiliate or any of its related bodies corporate purchase or otherwise acquire Tokens from the Investor; (iv) any other form of participation in or relating to the Company or Token Affiliate; or (v) other right that may be implied by law.

3.  Documentation.

The Conditional Token Right will be documented in the form of a warrant or other token purchase right that will be exercisable at the discretion of the Investor.

4.  Termination.

The rights described herein shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the earlier of (a) such time as Investor no longer holds any equity interests or convertible securities of the Company; (b) 12 months from the date of this agreement where a Token has not been created by the Company or Token Affiliate; (c) the consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Company that is effected (i) for independent business reasons unrelated to extinguishing such rights; and (ii) for purposes other than (A) the reincorporation of the Company in a different state or (B) the formation of a holding company that will be owned exclusively by the Company’s equity holders and will hold all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company’s successors.

5.  Representations and Warranties.

(a) The Investor represents and warrants that: (i) if the Investor is an individual, you are of the full age of majority in the jurisdiction in which any Tokens are purchased and are legally competent to enter into such a transaction, to perform all of your obligations under this agreement, and are to undertake all actions required in accordance with this agreement; (ii) if the Investor is not an individual, you have the requisite power, authority, legal capacity and competence to purchase Tokens, to perform all of your obligations under this agreement, and all necessary approvals of your directors, partners, shareholders, trustees or otherwise with respect to such matters have been given or obtained; (iii) this agreement has been validly accepted by the Investor, and constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation, on the Investor, in the jurisdiction in which it is accepted; (iv) the acceptance of this agreement and the purchasing of Tokens do not, and will not, result in a violation of any law, regulation, order or ruling applicable to the Investor, and do not, and will not, constitute a breach of, or a default under, the Investor’s constituent documents (if you are not an individual) or any agreement to which you are a party, or by which you are bound; (v) you acknowledge that the any issuance of Tokens may be subject to a Token sale agreement or equivalent agreement issued by the Company or Token Affiliate; (vi) you confirm that: (A) you have such knowledge in financial and business affairs as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of your purchase of Tokens; (B) you are capable of assessing the proposed purchase of Tokens as a result of your own experience; (C) you are aware of the characteristics of Tokens and the risks relating to the purchase of Tokens; and (D) you are able to bear the economic risk of the loss of your investment in Tokens; (vii) you have been independently advised to consult with your own legal advisors as to: (A) restrictions with respect to purchasing Tokens; and (B) the suitability of purchasing Tokens as relevant to your financial situation, the tax consequences of purchasing and dealing with Tokens; and (viii) you acknowledge that this agreement is not a disclosure document (including but not limited to a prospectus or product disclosure statement) and no such document has been filed by the Company or Token Affiliate with any securities commission or similar regulatory authority in any jurisdiction in connection with the issuance of Tokens and the issuance is exempted from the disclosure document requirements under applicable laws.

(b) The Company represents and warrants to the Investor that: (i) it is a body corporate validly existing under the laws of its place of incorporation; (ii) it has the power and capacity to enter into and perform its obligations under this agreement and to own its assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted; (iii) it and its directors have taken all necessary action to authorize the signing, delivery and performance of this agreement and the documents required under this agreement in accordance with their respective terms; (iv) this agreement constitutes valid and binding obligations upon it enforceable in accordance with its terms; (v) to the best of the Company’s knowledge, there is no pending or threatened proceeding affecting the Company or any of its related bodies corporate before a court, authority, commission or arbitrator.
