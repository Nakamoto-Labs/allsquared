315.45 Consultancy agreement[Current to ]

[Under this agreement, the consultant agrees to provide IT-related services to the customer. This precedent is of a generic nature and is designed for adaptation to any unique situation involving the physical delivery of services, which might range from programming to evaluation to system analysis.

Similar but more specific agreements of this nature may take the form of enterprise architecture analysis agreements (Pr 315.74), gap analysis agreements (Pr 315.75), scoping agreements (Pr 315.77) and penetration testing agreements (Pr 315.79).

This template in its generic form will prove to be relatively simple to negotiate. It is likely that the schedules describing services and addressing issues such as feels and liability will be the more complex aspects of negotiation.]
