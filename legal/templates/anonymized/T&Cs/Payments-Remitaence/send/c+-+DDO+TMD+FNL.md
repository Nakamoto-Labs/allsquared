A distributor must only provide general advice (such

•

marketing material available to the general public

(including most

marketing)

channels relevant to the making of foreign
exchange transactions;
•

in person recommendations to access marketing
and promotional materials (including in branch
communications); and

•

any other communication channels (including
telephone, email and social media).

This condition is appropriate as the target market for
the product is narrow.
It is intended that these channels may be available to
persons who may not at that time require this kind of
product, for example because they are not presently
needing to exchange a foreign currency. This is
because the issue of the product is subject to
Distribution Conditions 1, 3 and 4 which will ensure that
the product is only issued to persons for whom it will
be appropriate.

to confirm that the consumer is in the target market.
