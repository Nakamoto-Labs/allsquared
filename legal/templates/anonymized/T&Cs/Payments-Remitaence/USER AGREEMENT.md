Receiving a payment request from a Seller

If you are purchasing something from a Seller, the Seller may initiate a payment request. You will then receive a notification from the [PARTY] app that a payment request from the Seller has been initiated and we’ll request you to confirm the payment request. When you confirm this request you authorise us to:

-   Debit funds on your behalf from your applicable linked bank account;

-   Transfer the funds to the Seller according to your instructions and subject to this User Agreement;

Sellers must treat [PARTY] as a payment method and mark at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, wherever [PARTY]'s branded services are integrated, including your websites, and mobile applications. This includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale. Further, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of [PARTY]'s services or marks.

In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterise any [PARTY] service as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over any [PARTY] service. Within all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using [PARTY] or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method. If you enable your customers to pay you with [PARTY] whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising and other customer communications) you agree to display the [PARTY] services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positively a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.

It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.

[PARTY] will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment. If the payment is completed, [PARTY] will provide notice to you to ship the item. Otherwise, [PARTY] will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the Buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action. This is in accordance with our AML/CTF Policy.

In-store payments and QR code transactions

If you’re a Seller and accept [PARTY] payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place. You may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorised. You must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one. You agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.

Marketplace Sellers

If you're a Seller on a marketplace or through a third party application where [PARTY] is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace's or the third party application's Buyer protection policy (or equivalent) for sales you make through that forum. Any such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.

Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments

[PARTY] Account Limitations

Limitations are implemented to help protect [PARTY], Buyers and Sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious. Limitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your [PARTY] account open.

We may limit your access to sending, receiving or withdrawing funds for up to 180 days. A limitation may remain beyond 180 days if we reasonably believe there is still a risk to the integrity, security or reliability of us or our systems.

There are several reasons why your [PARTY] account could be limited, including:

-   If we hold a reasonable belief that there is an increased risk associated with your [PARTY] account or other service you receive from us or one of our affiliates.

-   If we suspect someone could be using your [PARTY] account without your knowledge, we'll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.

-   In order to comply with the law.

-   If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement.

-   Seller performance indicating your [PARTY] account is high risk. Examples include: indications of poor Seller performance because you've received an unusually high number of claims , selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, such as jewelry, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.

-   Reports of unauthorised or unusual bank account use associated with the account.

-   Abuse by a Buyer of the reversal process provided by the Buyer's bank.

-   Multiple disputes from your customers received regarding about non-despatch of

-   goods, non-delivery of services, goods not as described or problems with goods

-   shipped.

-   Receipt of potentially fraudulent funds.

-   Facilitation of fraudulent activity.

-   Excessive disputes or reversals.

-   Refusal to cooperate in an investigation or with our requirements to verify your identity when requested.

-   Initiation of transactions considered to be cash advances or assisting in cash advances.

-   Sending unsolicited emails or posting referral links on websites where they are not permitted.

-   Return of an incoming electronic funds transfer for insufficient funds or incorrect bank details.

-   Use of an anonymising proxy.

-   Reports from third parties of a high level of risk.

-   The occurrence of an insolvency event.

-   Failure to provide us with information about you or your business activities that we may reasonably request.

-   if [PARTY] cannot provide its services to you in accordance with any existing or new conditions applied by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) or any other government agency in Australia;

-   if [PARTY] determines, in its sole discretion, that the account holder does not meet the Target Market Determination of its third party payments provider.

-   Any other activities which we reasonably deem as high risk selling or receiving activity.

-   You must resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed. Normally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request. However, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect [PARTY], our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability. The actions we may take include:

    -   Return funds to the sender and restore access to your account;

    -   Continue to limit your account access to protect us against the risk of reversals,

    -   legal and/or regulatory risk or because we may be prohibited by law from releasing funds or unrestricting your account;

    -   Refuse to provide our services to you in the future.

There may be certain situations where there is no specific action that you can take to help remove the limitation (for example, the limitation is put in place due to policies we have to ensure we're in compliance with laws). If you find that your [PARTY] account has been limited, you should either review the email you receive from us informing you that your [PARTY] account is limited, or log in to your [PARTY] account for additional details about the limitation on your [PARTY] account.

Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process

If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your [PARTY] account, placing a limitation on your [PARTY] account, or releasing your funds. We will decide, in our sole discretion acting reasonably, which action is required of us. Unless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions. We do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your [PARTY] account. When we implement a hold, limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, limitation may remain in place longer than 180 days.

Personal fraud warning

We're always looking for ways to help keep you even more secure. So stay on the lookout for some of these common scams:

-   Spoofing: a scammer sends forged or faked electronic documents or emails falsely claiming to be [PARTY] or coming from [PARTY] but asks you to send money outside your [PARTY] account.

-   Relative in Need: a scammer impersonates a family member (commonly grandchildren) and claims there is an emergency requiring you to send money.

-   Lottery or Prize: a scammer informs you that you've won a lottery or prize and must send money in order to claim it.

-   Debt Collection: a scammer impersonates a debt collector and induces you to send money using threats or intimidation.

-   Employment Related: a scammer instructs you to send money in connection with a fraudulent offer of employment.

Always use common sense when sending money. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Only send money for yourself and not for others. Please let us know immediately if you believe someone is trying to scam or defraud you by contacting us.

Dormant accounts

If you do not access log in to your [PARTY] account for one or more years, [PARTY] may close your [PARTY] account.

Your use (as a Seller) of personal data; Data protection laws

If you (as a Seller) receive personal data about another [PARTY] customer, you must keep such personal data confidential and only use it in connection with the [PARTY] services. You may not disclose or distribute any personal data about [PARTY] customers to a third party or use such personal data for marketing purposes unless you receive that customer's express consent to do so.

To the extent that you process any personal data about a [PARTY] customer pursuant to this agreement, you and [PARTY] will each be an independent data controller (and not joint controllers), meaning we will each separately determine the purposes and means of processing such personal data. We each agree to comply with the requirements of any applicable privacy and data protection laws, including any applicable regulations, directives, codes of practice, and regulatory requirements applicable to data controllers in connection with this agreement. We each also have and will follow our own independently-determined privacy statements, notices, policies, and procedures for any such personal data that we process in connection with this agreement.

In complying with the applicable data protection laws, we will each:

-   implement and maintain all appropriate security measures in relation to the processing of such personal data;

-   maintain a record of all processing activities carried out under this agreement; and

-   not knowingly or intentionally do anything, or knowingly or intentionally permit anything to be done, which might lead to a breach by the other party of the applicable data protection laws.
