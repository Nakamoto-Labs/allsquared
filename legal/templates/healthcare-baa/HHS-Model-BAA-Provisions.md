A business associate agreement between a covered entity and a business associate must establish the permitted and required uses and disclosures of protected health information (PHI) by the business associate. The agreement may not authorize the business associate to use or further disclose the information in a manner that would violate the HIPAA Rules.

The sample provisions below are designed to help covered entities more easily comply with the business associate agreement requirements.
