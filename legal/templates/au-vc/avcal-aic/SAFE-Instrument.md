[^1]: At its simplest, a SAFE enables the Investor to make a cash investment in the Company in exchange for shares in the Company on a future event occurring (ie a capital raising) on the terms of the SAFE.

[^2]: This SAFE does not contain a maturity date (which is customary). A key difference between a SAFE and a convertible note is that a convertible note will often include a maturity date (being the date upon which the note must either convert or be redeemed).

[^3]: An Investor may want to enter into a separate side letter with the Company to secure pre-emptive rights and information rights during the period of the SAFE, given that the Investor may not be a shareholder during that time.

[^4]: The Qualifying Financing can be tied to a minimum fundraising round (ie a capital raising of \$X at a pre-money valuation of \$Y).

[^5]: This agreement calculates the number of shares that the Investor would receive on a future capital raising (called a Qualifying Financing) on the higher of a formula that uses a pre-agreed valuation cap and a formula that applies a discount rate to the price per share issued in that priced round. It is not uncommon for the calculation to be done by reference only to a discount rate.

[^6]: Note: some investors may require more substantive warranties from the Company, such as the status of the Company\'s intellectual property rights, financial accounts and so on.
