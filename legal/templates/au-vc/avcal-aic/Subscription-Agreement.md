It has taken all necessary action to authorise the signing, delivery and performance of this agreement and the documents required under this agreement in accordance with their respective terms.

[]{#_Toc475359872 .anchor}Schedule 5 Seed Preference Share Terms[^42]

**Seed Preference Shares**

These terms set out the terms of the Seed Preference Shares which may be issued by the Company.

Despite any other clause of these terms the Company is not required to comply with these Seed Preference Share Terms to the extent that to do so would contravene the Corporations Act.

**General rights attaching to Seed Preference Shares**

Subject to paragraphs 3 through 8, each Seed Preference Share confers on the holders of that Seed Preference Share all of the rights attaching to one fully paid ordinary share in the capital of the Company.

**Dividends**

Each Seed Preference Share is entitled to any dividend declared on ordinary shares equal to the dividend that would be payable on the number of ordinary shares into which such Seed Preference Share would convert into if it were to be so converted pursuant to paragraph 4 on the relevant dividend record date.[^43]

**Conversion**

Each Seed Preference Share will be convertible into ordinary shares. The initial conversion price is equal to the issue price of the relevant Seed Preference Share, with the conversion price adjusted pursuant to the operation of the terms of these Seed Preference Shares (**Conversion Price**).

Each holder of Seed Preference Shares is entitled to convert some or all of its Seed Preference Shares into ordinary shares at any time on 10 Business Days written notice to the Company (**Conversion Notice**).[^44]

A notice given by a holder of Seed Preference Shares pursuant to paragraph 4.2 must state:

the number of Seed Preference Shares to be converted into ordinary shares; and

the date on which such conversion is to occur (which must be no less than 10 Business Days after the date of such Conversion Notice) (**Conversion Date**).

On the Conversion Date:

the relevant Seed Preference Shares will be converted (by way of variation of rights, and not by way of redemption, cancellation or a new issue or allotment) into a number of ordinary shares determined by dividing the relevant purchase price paid per Seed Preference Share by the Conversion Price and multiplying that figure by the number of Seed Preference Shares to be converted and rounded to the nearest whole share; and

the Company will issue new share certificates to the relevant holder or holders of Seed Preference Shares relating to the new holding of Seed Preference Shares and ordinary shares.

**Anti-dilution**[^45]

If, prior to the conversion of any Seed Preference Shares, the Company:

reconstructs its share capital, the number of shares into which a Seed Preference Share may be converted must be reconstructed in the same manner; or

issues Shares at a price less than that paid by the holder of Seed Preference Shares, the Conversion Price will be amended as follows (calculated to the nearest tenth of a cent):

CP~2~ = CP~1~ \* (A + B) ÷ (A + C).

Where:

#### CP~2~ = the Conversion Price in effect immediately after such issue of equity securities;

#### CP~1~ = the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue of equity securities;

#### A = the number of ordinary shares of the Company issued or issuable upon exercise of options or securities convertible into ordinary shares immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion or exchange of all convertible preference shares outstanding (assuming exercise of all outstanding options or securities convertible into ordinary shares, immediately prior to such issue), but excluding any Seed Preference Shares that have not been converted;

#### B = the number of ordinary shares that would have been issued if such equity securities had been issued at a price per share equal to CP~1~ (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the Company in respect of such issue by CP~1~); and

#### C = the number of such equity securities issued in such transaction.

The following issues will not trigger an anti-dilution adjustment:

ordinary shares (or options to purchase such ordinary shares) issued under an employee incentive scheme approved in accordance with the Shareholder Agreement; or

shares (or options to purchase such share) issued as consideration other than for cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, acquisition or similar transaction or combination of transactions approved by the Board.

**Ranking**

With respect to amounts to be paid or repaid in respect of the Seed Preference Shares under these Seed Preference Share Terms, Seed Preference Shares will:

rank equally among themselves; and

rank senior to all other shares on issue in the capital of the Company.

**Preferential return of capital**[^46]

In this clause "**Liquidation Event**"[^47] means:

the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company;

the distribution of the Company's capital to the Company's shareholders (whether by return of capital, share buy-back, dividend or otherwise;

a sale of all or substantially all of the shares in the Company for cash or liquid securities;

a sale, lease, liquidation or other disposition of all material or substantially all material assets of the Company or the Business, for which it is resolved that the shareholders will receive the sale proceeds;

the closing of the issue or sale of ordinary shares in the Company to the public in a firm commitment public offering and the quoting of the ordinary shares of the Company, and the listing of the Company, on an internationally recognised stock exchange; or

an exit by way of granting an exclusive license of the Group\'s Intellectual Property Rights and milestone payments, for which it is resolved that the shareholders will receive the associated proceeds obtained by the Company.

If any Liquidation Event occurs, the holders of the Seed Preference Shares will be entitled to receive out of the proceeds of that Liquidation Event, in preference to any payments to the holders of any other shares or securities in the capital of the Company, the greater of:

an amount equal to the amount paid up on the Seed Preference Share plus any declared but unpaid dividends in respect of a Seed Preference Share (**Preference Amount**); or

the amount that would be payable to the holder in respect of each Seed Preference Share if all Seed Preference Shares were converted to ordinary shares immediately prior to the Liquidation Event.[^48]

**Variation of class rights**

The rights attached to the Seed Preference Shares may only be cancelled, varied or modified with the agreement (whether by resolution or written consent) of the holders of at least \[[75\]]{.mark}%[^49] in aggregate of the Seed Preference Shares on issue.

If shareholders holding at least \[[75\]]{.mark}% in aggregate of the Seed Preference Shares on issue agree (whether by resolution or written consent) to the cancellation, variation or modification, it takes effect:

if no later date is stated in the resolution or consent; on the date of the resolution or consent; or

on a later date specified in the resolution or written consent.

[^1]: This agreement assumes that there is only one Investor. Some changes will be required if there is more than one Investor under this agreement.

[^2]: This agreement assumes that there is more than one Founder.

[^3]: Insert the latest date on which the accounts have been prepared

[^4]: The Completion Date may be the date of the agreement if the parties want to sign and complete simultaneously.

[^5]: This agreement assumes that, prior to the Investor\'s subscription for Seed Preference Shares, there are only ordinary shares in the capital of the Company.

[^6]: Consider whether Founders should be Warrantors or not. As the Founders do not receive payment under this agreement, they may be unwilling to be personally liable for breach of the warranties. However, the Investor may require the Founders to stand behind the warranties as they know the business the best and particularly if the Investor has not carried out detailed due diligence investigations or if there has been a lack of information provided by the Founders. Further, the Investor may not wish to sue the Company for breach of warranty, as the Investor will be a shareholder in the Company at the time.

[^7]: This may be extended to specifically cover the knowledge of other executives who are not Founders. Certain Founders may request to remove the words \"and the awareness, knowledge or belief they would have had after making due and careful enquiry\" as this expands the breadth of their imputed knowledge. However, an Investor may consider this is reasonable, to avoid a situation where the Founders can claim ignorance of a matter of which they should have been aware.

[^8]: This agreement assumes that all Subscription Shares will be subscribed for in one tranche. If there are multiple tranches, then some amendments will be required.

[^9]: Consider whether any conditions precedent to Completion are required. For example, Completion could be conditional on (1) the renewal of a key contract, (2) finance being obtained by the Investor, (3) the consummation of another business transaction etc. If this is desired, the parties should consider the latest possible date by which the conditions precedent may be satisfied. If they are not satisfied by that date, then the parties should be able to terminate the transaction. In certain circumstances, a break fee may be payable.

[^10]: Consider whether any pre-completion covenants are required for the period between signing and completion. These are intended to (1) require the business to be run in the ordinary course and (2) give the Investor a veto over key decisions of the business (similar to the veto that it will have post-completion).

[^11]: If the Investor has the right to appoint a director to the Company, then it will be necessary to include an obligation on the Investor to deliver a consent to act as director to the Company.

[^12]: Consider whether any further Completion deliverables are required. For example, (1) employment agreements with key personnel (other than Founders), (2) transfer of assets from the name of the Founder to the name of the Company etc. Note also that other internal approvals may be required (ie as set out in a pre-existing shareholders agreement and/or constitution).

[^13]: Consider if this right should only apply to the non-defaulting party.

[^14]: It is not uncommon for Investors to require that a supporting general indemnity is given by the Warrantors in favour of the Investor. This indemnity will still usually be subject to the same limitations of liability that apply to the warranties.

[^15]: If a matter has been uncovered in the Investor\'s due diligence enquiries identifies a specific risk, or a matter that may result in a breach of a warranty, but such breach has not yet occurred, the Investor may require a specific indemnity for that matter. This is because the disclosure limitation may operate to prevent the Investor from bringing a claim for breach of warranty (or under the supporting general indemnity, if any).

[^16]: Parties will need to agree whether liability of the Warrantors is several or joint and several. If there is only one warrantor, then remove the words \"jointly and severally\".

[^17]: If there has been a data room or a disclosure letter prepared, this should instead be referenced in this clause. Note also US custom is not to allow for a broad disclosure \'shield\' and instead rely only on a disclosure schedule to qualify the warranties. Either approach will need to be negotiated between the parties.

[^18]: Consider whether 24 months is an appropriate length of time. In particular, title and tax warranties may require a longer claim period.

[^19]: It is not uncommon to carve-out certain matters (such as title and capacity, and sometimes tax) from certain limitations.

[^20]: Warrantors may request that there be certain minimum thresholds that have to be reached before the Investor is able to make a claim, to prevent the risk of small claims being made. This may apply in respect of each individual claim (eg the Warrantors have no liability for breach of warranty unless the amount of any claim arising out of the breach is \$10,000 or more) or in respect of all claims (eg the Warrantors have no liability for breach of warranty unless the aggregate amount of all claims is \$100,000 or more) or both. Typically, if these thresholds are included, the Investor will have the right to claim for the whole amount and not just the excess over the threshold.

[^21]: In some instances it may be appropriate to allow for any claim to be settled through a new issue of shares to the investor. This is commonly dealt with through a gross-up mechanism (see comment below).

[^22]: It is not uncommon to include a \'gross up\' clause in relation to breaches of warranties by the Warrantors. This is to prevent the risk of a claim being made by the Investor against the Company, when the Investor is already a shareholder in the Company (and therefore the Investor effectively bears some of the burden of making good the claim). The gross up clause operates to gross up the amount of the claim, so that the Investor effectively does not bear the burden of making good the claim.

[^23]: Consider whether to include a dispute resolution clause.

[^24]: If the parties wish to have no rights against each other moving forward, they should release each other separately.

[^25]: Consider whether an exception is required to permit one or more of the parties to make a public announcement in relation to the transaction.

[^26]: It is quite common for the Company to pay the Investor\'s legal fees, when dealing with venture capital funds. The Investor will generally not be entitled to a full input tax credit in respect of the GST component of the legal costs, so the GST amount should be included in the amount to be reimbursed to the extent it is not fully creditable in accordance with clause 8.2

[^27]: The cap table is presented on a \'fully diluted\' basis, meaning that it includes an allocation for ESOP (and other securities that may be convertible into shares). Parties will need to agree the size of the ESOP pool. Note that it is common for the investor\'s holding percentage to be calculated on a fully diluted basis so that they are not diluted by any increase in the ESOP pool as part of the investment.

[^28]: In the event that there is a shareholders agreement in place prior to the Investor\'s subscription for shares, it is likely that a waiver of pre-emption rights will be required from all existing shareholders in the Company.

[^29]: In some instances, investors may expect a more robust information warranty, including words to the effect that the information has been provided in good faith and that the Group and its Representatives have disclosed and have not knowingly or recklessly withheld from the Investor any information that a subscriber for the Subscription Shares would reasonably require to make an informed assessment of the assets and liabilities, financial position and performance of the Group. The Company should consider whether it is inappropriate, in the circumstances, to give such a broad information warranty.

[^30]: If there has been a period of time between the preparation of the Accounts and signing/completion, then the Investor may require certain warranties in relation to the operation of the business (and its liabilities) in that period.

[^31]: Various other business warranties are commonly required by Investors. If the main asset of the business is its IP, then more substantial warranties in relation to IP and IT will be required. Investors may also require warranties in relation to litigation, properties, employees, compliance with laws and industry codes, tax etc.

[^32]: **Business Intellectual Property Rights** means all Intellectual Property Rights generated, developed, created or used by the Group in relation to the Business, but not including the Technology IP and the Licensed IP.

[^33]: Note, it is not uncommon for some investors to require that a list of all registered IP be included in a separate schedule to the subscription agreement (or in a separate side/disclosure letter).

[^34]: **Licensed IP** means the Intellectual Property Rights licensed to any Group Company.

[^35]: **Technology IP** means all Intellectual Property Rights subsisting in any software, hardware, services or service outputs, business processes, documentation, data storage devices, peripherals or data used, exercised, accessed or otherwise used that has been created, developed or used by the Group in relation to the Business, but excluding Licensed IP.

[^36]: **IP Licence** means a licence granted by a third party to a Group Company in respect of Intellectual Property Rights owned by that third party.

[^37]: **Tax**, as already defined in the definitions section, means any tax, levy, charge, impost, fee, deduction, GST or withholding tax that is assessed, levied, imposed or collected by any Government Agency and includes any interest, fine, penalty, charge, fee or any other amount imposed on, or in respect of, any of the above.

[^38]: **Tax Authority** means any federal, state, territory or local Government Agency for Tax.

[^39]: **Accounts** mean the balance sheet of the Group and the profit and loss statement and cash flow statement of the Group at the Accounts Date. Company to refine the definition and the suitability of these warranties having regard to the nature of the accounts being warranted, including whether they are audited or not.

[^40]: **Accounting Standards** means: (a) accounting standards approved under the Corporations Act and its requirements about the preparation and contents of accounts; and (if relevant) (b) in respect of the annual audited financial accounts, the Australian Accounting Standards issued and updated from time to time by the Australian Accounting Standards Board.

[^41]: Consider whether a warranty is required that the Investor is a sophisticated or professional investor. This may be necessary depending on the amount that the Investor is investing, how many other shares have been issued in the previous 12 months and the company\'s proposed fundraising efforts in the following 12 months.

[^42]: These Seed Preference Share Terms must also be set out in the Company\'s Constitution.

[^43]: Consider whether a preferred dividend right should apply. Such dividends could be cumulative or non-cumulative.

[^44]: Conversion may also be mandatory if a majority of the Seed Preference Shareholders agree or if there is an IPO or such other exit that meets certain agreed thresholds (eg 3x the subscription price).

[^45]: This agreement includes a broad-based, weighted-average anti-dilution right. Other anti-dilution rights may be appropriate, including full ratchet. The intention of the clause is to give the Investor a \"top up\" in the event that shares are issued at a price that is lower than what the Investor pays (which is called a \'down round\'). In contrast to a full ratchet adjustment, a broad based adjustment takes into account money actually being raised by the company in the down round and as a result the net impact is not as severe as in a full ratchet adjustment.

[^46]: This agreement includes a non-participating liquidation preference, which is the most common form of preference share. In some instances (particularly if the balance of power is with the Investor), Investors may require a participating liquidation preference (this would give them first rights to receive back their subscription price, then they would rank equally with ordinary shareholders in the distribution of the remaining assets of the company).

[^47]: These events are commonly triggers for a Liquidation Event. However, the Company (and Founders) should carefully consider whether the events listed under Liquidation Event are appropriate triggers for the payment of the liquidation preference on the Seed Preference Shares.

[^48]: Liquidation preferences in venture investments vary depending on the state of the market and the competitiveness of the deal.  A 1X liquidation preference is fairly standard (which is what has been provided here). This means that if the company is wound up or sold, the holders of the Seed Preference Shares will receive back 1X times the amount that they paid on their shares before any other shareholder receives any proceeds. Participating preferences, preferences with a \>1x liquidation preference may also be applicable/suitable in the context of a transaction.

[^49]: Relevant percentage to be agreed between the parties.

[^50]: Use this execution block where the Company has two or more directors.

[^51]: Use this execution block where the Company has a sole director and sole secretary.
