### If the Company notifies the Founder or Founder Entity (as applicable) that it wishes to buy back or require a compulsory transfer of the Default Shares under clause 12.1(a), the Founder or Founder Entity (as applicable) and the other Shareholders must do everything necessary to facilitate the sale of the Default Shares to the Company or the Company's nominee within 10 Business Days of the Company\'s notice. 

### Despite clauses 12.1(a) and 12.1(b), the Company may only buy back the Default Shares if that is permitted under Part 2J.1 of the Corporations Act and, for the avoidance of doubt, if the buyback will not materially prejudice the Company\'s ability to pay its creditors.

## Price for Default Shares

The price for the Default Shares (**Default Price**) is \[[50]{.mark}\]% of Fair Market Value.

## Other remedies

The rights and remedies set out in this clause do not exclude any other rights or remedies that a party may have against a party in default of this agreement.

## Suspension

To the extent that the Law allows, from the time of giving notice under clause 12.1:

### the Founder or Founder Entity (as applicable) and any person appointed as a Director by that party is deemed to have provided a resignation notice to the Company at the same time as a Founder or Founder Entity (as applicable) is notified pursuant to clause 12.1 and is automatically removed from the Board at that time, and has no further right to participate in the Business or management of the Group; and

### the rights of the relevant Founder or Founder Entity (as applicable) as a holder of Securities (including dividend and distribution rights in relation to Securities, and the rights to attend and vote at general meetings of Shareholders and to receive information and documents) are suspended until those Securities have been acquired by the Company or as directed by the Company.

## Fair Market Value 

### The Board will determine by Required Resolution the Fair Market Value of the Default Shares and will notify the Founder within 5 Business Days of such determination.

### If the Board is unable to determine the Fair Market Value by required Resolution, the Board must appoint an Independent Expert to determine the Fair Market Value.

# Non-competition 

## Enforceability and severance

### This clause has effect as if it were separate and independent clauses, each one being severable from the others and consisting of the covenant set out in clause 13.2 combined with each separate period referred to in clause 13.3, and each combination combined with each separate area referred to in clause 13.4.

### If any of these separate clauses are void, invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it will be deemed to be severed to the extent that it is void or to the extent of voidability, invalidity or unenforceability and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other separate clause or other combinations of the separate provisions of clauses 13.2, 13.3 and 13.4.

# Goods and Services Tax

## Definitions

In this clause:

### **GST** means \"GST\" as defined *in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax)* *Act 1999* as amended (**GST Act**) or any replacement or other relevant legislation and regulations;

### words used in this clause which have a particular meaning in the GST law (as defined in the GST Act, and also including any applicable legislative determinations and Australian Taxation Office public rulings) have the same meaning, unless the context otherwise requires;

### any reference to GST payable by a party includes any corresponding GST payable by the representative member of any GST group of which that party is a member; and

### if the GST law treats part of a supply as a separate supply for the purpose of determining whether GST is payable on that part of the supply or for the purpose of determining the tax period to which that part of the supply is attributable, such part of the supply is to be treated as a separate supply.

## General exclusion of GST

Unless GST is expressly included, the consideration expressed to be payable under any other clause of this agreement for any supply made under or in connection with this agreement does not include GST.

## Gross-up of Taxable Supply

To the extent that any supply made under or in connection with this agreement is a taxable supply, the GST exclusive consideration otherwise payable for that supply is increased by an amount equal to that consideration multiplied by the rate at which GST is imposed in respect of the supply, and is payable at the same time.

## Further acts

Each party agrees to do all things, including providing tax invoices and other documentation, that may be necessary or desirable to enable or assist the other party to claim any input tax credit, adjustment or refund in relation to any amount of GST paid or payable in respect of any supply made under or in connection with this agreement.

## Reimbursement and indemnity

If a payment to a party under this agreement is a payment by way of reimbursement or indemnity and is calculated by reference to the GST inclusive amount of a loss, cost or expense incurred by that party, then the payment is to be reduced by the amount of any input tax credit to which that party is entitled in respect of that loss, cost or expense before any adjustment is made for GST pursuant to clause 17.3.

# Costs and expenses

## Stamp duty

The Company must pay all stamp duty on this agreement and any instrument or document executed under this agreement.

## Transaction costs

Except as agreed between the parties, each party must bear its own legal and other costs and expenses of and incidental to the preparation and execution of this agreement.

# General

## Notices

Any notice given under or in connection with this agreement (**Notice**):

### must be in writing and signed by a person duly authorised by the sender;

### must be addressed and delivered to the intended recipient by hand, by prepaid post, by fax or by email at the address, fax number or email address last notified by the intended recipient to the sender; and

### is taken to be given and made:

#### in the case of hand delivery, when delivered; 

#### in the case of delivery by post, three Business Days after the date of posting (if posted to an address in the same country) or seven Business Days after the date of posting (if posted to an address in another country); 

#### in the case of a fax, on the day and at the time it is sent, provided that the sender's facsimile machine issues a report confirming the transmission of the number of pages in the Notice; and

#### in the case of an email, on the day and at the time that the recipient confirms the email is received.

This clause does not limit the way in which a notice can be deemed to be served under any Law.

## Governing law and jurisdiction

### The laws applicable in \[[insert]{.mark}\] govern this agreement.

### The parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of \[[insert]{.mark}\] and any courts competent to hear appeals from those courts.

## Invalidity

### A word or provision must be read down if:

#### this agreement is void, voidable, or unenforceable if it is not read down; 

#### this agreement will not be void, voidable or unenforceable if it is read down; and

#### the provision is capable of being read down.

### A word or provision must be severed if:

#### despite the operation of clause 19.3(a), the provision is void, voidable or unenforceable if it is not severed; and

#### this agreement will be void, voidable or unenforceable if it is not severed.

### The remainder of this agreement has full effect even if clause 19.3(b)(i) or 19.3(b)(ii) applies.

## Agreement and Constitution

### If there is an inconsistency between this agreement and the Constitution, the provisions of this agreement prevail. An inconsistency will be considered to exist if, regardless of the purpose of the provision, the relevant subject matter or action to be taken (including the issue or Disposal of Securities) is dealt with differently in both the Constitution and this agreement.

### If necessary, the Shareholders must procure that the Constitution (and the constitution of each Subsidiary) is amended as soon as is practicable to ensure that a provision of this agreement is effective in accordance with its terms.

### To the maximum extent permitted by Law, the parties agree to waive any provisions contained in the Constitution to the extent that those provisions are inconsistent with the provisions in this agreement, so that they have no force or effect during the term of this agreement.

## Cumulative Rights

The rights and remedies in this agreement are in addition to other rights and remedies given by Law independently of this agreement.

## Entire agreement

This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes any prior negotiations, representations, understandings or arrangements made between the parties regarding the subject matter of this agreement, whether orally or in writing.

## Counterparts

This agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts. All counterparts taken together constitute one instrument.

## Relationship between parties

### Nothing in this agreement:

#### constitutes a partnership between the parties; or

#### except as expressly provided, makes a party an agent of another party for any purpose.

### A party cannot in any way or for any purpose:

#### bind another party; or

#### contract in the name of another party.

### If a party must fulfil an obligation and that party is dependent on another party, then that other party must do each thing reasonably within its power to assist the other in the performance of that obligation.

## Assignment

A party may not assign, transfer or in any other manner deal with its rights under this agreement.

## Further assurances

Each party must promptly execute all documents and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to give effect to the arrangements recorded in this agreement.

**Governing law**

**EXECUTED** as a deed poll

[^1]: Note that the intention of the Bad Leaver language is to treat Founders as good leavers unless the Bad Leaver language applies (and as a result a very narrow definition of Bad Leaver applies). In other words, Founders will always be good leavers unless they are Bad Leavers. It is not uncommon for employee shareholders to be treated the opposite way -- they are bad leavers unless they are good leavers (and the distinction is often set out in ESOP documentation).

[^2]: Between 12 months to 3 years is considered standard.

[^3]: Note that including resignation within the definition of a Bad Leaver may be seen as an aggressive approach against the Founders.

[^4]: It is important to accurately define the Business, as this definition will impact, among other things, the scope of the restraint.

[^5]: This definition is used in the clause setting out the process if the company wishes to issue shares. Importantly, pre-emptive rights will not apply to any Excluded Issue. Therefore, it is important that all parties consider the circumstances in which the pre-emptive rights should not apply. This document assumes there will be an ESOP or similar employee incentive scheme (ie. Share Plan), and that the issue of securities under that scheme should also be an Excluded Issued.

[^6]: Consider what threshold is appropriate or whether instead a required resolution should be a resolution passed by a simple majority of directors, with other thresholds such as requiring that the director appointed by the Investor is in the majority.

[^7]: Some investors will require a greater proportion when exercising their pre-emptive rights on the issue of shares. For example, an investor may require 2x its pro rata rights.

[^8]: The 75% threshold is consistent with the Corporations Act requirements for a Special Resolution of shareholders and should not be lowered. However, a higher figure may be agreed.

[^9]: Consider if an independent Director is required where there are a smaller number of Directors (e.g. less than 4).

[^10]: This agreement does not provide for any director fees to be payable. If director fees will be payable, then this may be set out here.

[^11]: A threshold for director appointment is common for Founder shareholders. Investors are unlikely to want Founders to be able to sell their shares and still retain the right to appoint a director.

[^12]: In certain circumstances, certain preference shareholders will require a specific right to appoint a director (rather than it being necessary that they hold a majority of the preference shares).

[^13]: Certain investors will require the Company to take out D&O insurance before appointing a director and/or may require that the Company enter into a deed of access, indemnity and insurance with their nominee director.

[^14]: Parties may wish to allow a particular shareholder to retain its board seat despite that shareholder not holding the requisite number of shares.

[^15]: Certain investors may require the right to appoint an observer to the board.

[^16]: This agreement is drafted on the basis that almost all key decisions are made by the board, rather than by shareholders.

[^17]: This agreement is drafted on the basis that the only decisions that require a Special Resolution are ones for which a special resolution is required under the Corporations Act. Some investors may require specific \'veto\' rights over certain matters.

[^18]: Consider whether there should be any limitations on founders selling their shares for a certain period of time (ie a Founder lock-up). This gives security to the investors that the founders will remain engaged in the business for a period of time.

[^19]: The purpose of this clause is to avoid a situation where a security interest is granted over shares, the grantor defaults and the financier becomes entitled to own the shares.

[^20]: This agreement is drafted on the basis that all shareholders have pre-emptive rights. However, it is quite common for those rights to be restricted to preference shareholders.

[^21]: Consider whether a shareholder should be able to nominate an Affiliate to exercise its pre-emptive rights. This may be particularly important for venture capital funds if the one fund has ended and a new fund has been established.

[^22]: The purpose of this clause is for the shareholders to agree that an employee incentive plan will be established and to put limits on the number of securities that may be issued under that plan.

[^23]: 10% is typically allocated for the ESOP pool.

[^24]: Consider whether a Required Resolution should be required.

[^25]: This agreement is drafted on the basis that all shareholders have pre-emptive rights. However, it is quite common for those rights to be restricted to preference shareholders.

[^26]: A tag along right gives the right to minority shareholders to \'tag along\' in a sale by a majority shareholder to a third party. The minority seller would sell on the same terms and conditions as the majority seller. This clause gives some protection to minority shareholders.

[^27]: A drag along right gives the right to majority shareholders to \'drag along\' (ie force) a minority shareholder in a sale of all of the shares in the company.

[^28]: Consider whether this limitation is appropriate or whether a different limitation should apply (eg that Shareholders holding Seed Preference Shares may only be dragged if they will receive cash consideration of an aggregate value equal to, for example, 3x the amount paid by that shareholder for their shares or that the drag may only be exercised on Shareholders holding Seed Preference Shares more than 3 years after their first acquired their shares).

[^29]: Note that the pre-emptive rights process will not apply in the event that the drag along provisions are triggered.

[^30]: It is not uncommon to include \'Defaulting Shareholder\' clauses. These clauses give the company the right to buy back shares held by a \'defaulting shareholder\', usually at a discount to their fair market value. A defaulting shareholder may be (1) a shareholder who is no longer permitted to hold shares under the law, (2) a shareholder who sells their shares in breach of this agreement, (3) a shareholder who has a change of control which has not been approved by the board or (4) a shareholder who is bankrupt or insolvent. These clauses are all designed to ensure the identity of the shareholders remains the same and that no new party becomes entitled to hold the shares. A defaulting shareholder may also be a shareholder that breaches key sections of this agreement (eg confidentiality and restraint provisions). In that case, a larger discount to fair market value is likely to be appropriate in any buyback.

[^31]: Consider inserting a Power of Attorney, so that the buyback rights in this clause may be exercised under power of attorney if the Founder refuses to do so.

[^32]: This clause is included as a mechanism to ensure that Founders remain actively engaged in the business, otherwise their shares are bought back for a nominal price. This agreement includes a relatively standard vesting schedule, but this may be altered as deemed fit. Although this agreement contemplates that some percentage of the Founder\'s shares may be vested, all shares may instead be unvested at the commencement of this agreement.

[^33]:

[^34]: The payment of consideration for the grant of the option by the Founder Option in this clause 11.2 is intended to minimise the risk that a material capital gain arises under CGT event D2 arises for the Founder Entity

[^35]: There are complex tax issues that can arise for the Founder Entity and the Company if the shares are bought back. Appropriate tax advice should be obtained as to whether it is preferable to buy-back the shares or transfer them to a nominated entity.

[^36]: This agreement only contemplates a right to buy back shares from a Founder if they are a Bad Leaver. It does not give the company the right to buy back shares from a Founder if they cease to be employed but are not a Bad Leaver. However, it is quite common for Investors to require that the Company be given that broader right. This is intended to prevent the Founder from remaining a shareholder in a company in which they are no longer engaged (it also allows the Company to \'recirculate\' the equity to new hires) -- the justification is that a Founder holds his or her shares because they are actively engaged in the business. This is different to an Investor, who holds their shares because they have made a financial investment into the business. The buy-back right often falls away as the business grows.

[^37]: Consider inserting a Power of Attorney, so that the buyback rights in this clause may be exercised under power of attorney if the Founder refuses to do so.

[^38]: The price for Unvested Shares in the context of a Bad Leaver situation (or any termination of employment or engagement) will be \$1 (as set out in clause 11.2), whereas the buyback price for vested shares (called \"Default Shares\") in a Bad Leaver situation will be a specified percentage of the Fair Market Value of those shares.

[^39]: Note that this clause and the obligations in it are drafted on the basis that they do not apply to the Investor. That is, there is no restriction on the Investor competing with the business or soliciting employees or clients. However, certain circumstances or elements may dictate that Investors should be bound by these restraints in which case they may be amended, although investors may want a carve-out which will still allow them to continue to invest in other competitor entities.

[^40]: These time periods can be tailored as appropriate.

[^41]: These geographical areas can be tailored as appropriate.

[^42]: If parties are overseas entities, arbitration of disputes may be more effective than court processes in Australia.

[^43]: Consider whether mediation is appropriate or whether another dispute resolution mechanism may be preferable (ie. arbitration), in which case this clause will need to be amended as appropriate.

[^44]: These matters should be tailored as appropriate for the business. Each of these matters needs a Required Resolution, so the parties need to consider whether this will be overly burdensome for the company and prevent it from operating in the ordinary course.

[^45]: Use this execution block where the Company has two or more directors.

[^46]: Use this execution block where the Company has a sole director and sole secretary.

[^47]: Use this execution block where a shareholder is an individual.

[^48]: Use this execution block where a shareholder is a company and has two or more directors.
