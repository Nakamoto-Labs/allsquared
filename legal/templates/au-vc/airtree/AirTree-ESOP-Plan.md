**Schedule 1**

# **How does an Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) operate?**

> Option plans are often used to retain key talent and to provide a longer term incentive to stay with the company.
>
> Where employees receive options under an ESOP, they receive a right (but not an obligation) to purchase shares in the company at a specified time in the future, for an agreed price (the exercise price). When employees convert their options into shares this is referred to as exercising their options. Generally, options cannot be exercised immediately but might require certain conditions to be satisfied before they can be exercised. These are often referred to as vesting conditions and typically relate to company performance and/or or length of service.
>
> Options usually have an exercise period of three to four years. During the period that an employee holds the options they are generally not entitled to dividends or voting rights, and generally cannot sell their options. However, once options are exercised and the underlying shares issued, employees generally receive the full benefits of being a shareholder.

# **Vesting criteria**

### The invitation to eligible employees may include details of any vesting criteria before the options acquired by the employee become fully vested and are capable of exercise. These criteria may include minimum tenure periods specified by the Board at the time of invitation.

### Once any vesting criteria are satisfied, the options become capable of exercise, subject to the participant paying the exercise price to the company. 

# **Rights attaching to shares issued under the ESOP**

### Shares issued under an ESOP must be ordinary shares.

# **Leavers**

# Usually, all unvested options automatically lapse with effect on the date the Optionholder ceases to be employed. Vested but unexercised options may also be subject to similar arrangements, but it is not uncommon for the relevant employee to have an ability to exercise the option within a certain period of time following cessation of employment. \"Good leaver\"/\"bad leaver\" arrangements often dictate what happens at this point in time.

# **Buy-back rights**

### The company may have the right to buy-back shares acquired on exercise of options. This is particularly the case if the employee is a "bad leaver". If the company may buy-back shares from "good leavers" and "bad leavers", the prices at which those shares may be bought back will generally differ depending on whether the employee is a "good leaver" or a "bad leaver".

# **Concessional tax rules under 'ESS start-up concession'** 

> Options (issued under a Start-up compliant ESOP) will not be taxed on grant, vesting or exercise. Rather, the taxing point will be deferred until the sale of the shares (or disposal of the options) which will generally be a CGT event. The 50% CGT discount will apply if the sale of the shares occurs at least 12 months after the grant of the Options.

# **What are the 'start-up eligibility criteria'?** 

## The company that grants the ESS interests (options in this case) must have had an aggregated turnover of less than \$50 million in the income year prior to the year the interests are granted. The turnover test includes connected entities but certain eligible investors in the company, including eligible venture capital investors and any exempt entity that is a deductable gift recipient, are treated as unconnected. 

## The company (and its corporate group) must not have any interests listed on an approved stock exchange in the income year prior to the ESS interest being offered. 

### The company (and its connected entities) must have been incorporated for less than 10 years. 

### The employing company (which can be a subsidiary of the company granting the ESS interests are being offered) must be an Australian resident taxpayer. 

# **Eligibility criteria for the terms of the ESS offer** 

## The only interests that can be acquired under the ESS must be ordinary shares or options to acquire ordinary shares, or rights (including Options) to acquire ordinary shares. 

## The ESS interests must be held for a minimum holding period of 3 years (commencing on the date the ESS interests were acquired). However, this period can be shortened depending on circumstances.

## The exercise price must not be less than the market value of shares in the company at the date of grant of the options. 

# **Eligibility criteria for employees** 

> Employees cannot hold more than 10% ownership or voting rights in the company in which the ESS interests are being granted --- including vested and unvested options and aggregating both the current and previous grants.

**Schedule 2**

# **How does a Loan Plan operate?**

## Broadly speaking, under a Loan Plan:

## the employing Company grants a loan to the employee, the proceeds of which are used to acquire (usually by way of subscription) shares in the Company; and

## in ordinary circumstances, the shares are acquired at market value.

# **What are the characteristics of the loan?**

## The loan usually:

### is limited-recourse (i.e. the company has no claim against the employee other than as against the shares issued to the employee); and

### has a benchmark rate of interest (although, whether a rate must apply may depend on a number of factors).

## The loan is repaid is generally by applying any dividends that are paid by the Company towards paying down the loan.

## Any outstanding part of the loan is usually repayable if:

### the employee ceases to be employed by the Company; or

### an exit event occurs in respect of the Company. 

# **Vesting criteria**

### The invitation to eligible employees may include details of any vesting criteria before the shares acquired by the employee become fully vested. These criteria may include minimum tenure periods specified by the Board at the time of invitation.

# **Rights attaching to shares issued under the Loan Plan**

### Shares issued under a Loan Plan may have all rights which the holder of ordinary shares has, or they may have limited rights.

# **Buy-back rights**

## As employees will receive all shares upfront, it is important to have clear methods in place for the company to buy-back (or otherwise procure the transfer of) shares if the employee ceases to be employed. Options include:

## the company has an explicit right to buy back a decreasing number of shares each month over a set period (usually 2-3 years) if the employee ceases to be employed by the company -- that is:

### on month one, the company may buy back 100% of the shares if the employee ceases to be employed during that month; 

### on month two, the company may buy back 35/36ths of the shares (based on a three year vesting cycle) if the employee ceases to be employed during that month; and

### on month three, the company may buy back 34/36ths of the shares (based on a three year vesting cycle) if the employee ceases to be employed during that month, etc.;

## the company has an explicit right to buy back a decreasing number of shares each month over a set period (usually 2-3 years), but there is a one year cliff, if the employee ceases to be employed by the company -- that is:

### at any time during the first 12 months after issue, the company may buy back 100% of the shares if the employee ceases to be employed during that 12 months; 

### on month thirteen, the company may buy back 23/36ths of the shares (based on a three year vesting cycle) if the employee ceases to be employed during that month; and

### on month fourteen, the company may buy back 22/36ths of the shares (based on a three year vesting cycle) if the employee ceases to be employed during that month, etc.;

## the company has an explicit right to buy back the shares if the employee ceases to be employed at any time during a set period; and

## the company has an explicit right to buy back the shares if the employee/company fails to reach relevant performance hurdles. 

### The buyback price where shares have not vested is usually an amount equal to the issue price per share (which is then used to repay that loan).

### In addition, the company may have the right to buy-back shares that have vested. This is particularly the case if the employee is a "bad leaver". If the company may buy-back shares from "good leavers" and "bad leavers", the prices at which those shares may be bought back will generally differ depending on whether the employee is a "good leaver" or a "bad leaver".

# **Tax consequences**

### Generally speaking, the following tax consequences will apply for participants under a loan plan:

## no income tax will be payable upfront (assuming the shares are issued at market value);

## when the shares are sold, tax will be payable on any capital gain (being the amount equal to the sale price minus the issue price). 

## Shares issued under a loan plan are immediately held on capital account and the time period to qualify for the 50% capital gains tax relief starts to run from day 1.

# **Key considerations**

## The key issues to consider with loan plans are: 

### whether any part of the loan will be deemed to be a dividend under Division 7A; and

### whether there are any fringe benefits tax issues.

## Company accounting issues need to be considered.

| Overview             | Australian corporate law regulates the manner in which \"Securities\" (i.e. shares or options) may be granted by Australian companies. These laws are often called the \"disclosure laws\" and, in broad terms, Securities may only be offered where certain statutory disclosure exemptions apply or otherwise a disclosure document (such as a prospectus or similar document) is made available.                                                                                                                                                                       |

If options are only exercisable at an exit event, it may be possible to exclude the exercise price paid or payable for those options from the calculation of the monetary cap, as monetary cap does not apply where there is a liquidity event that crystalizes the ability to exercise. |

# **Introduction**

## **Purpose**

> The purpose of the Plan is to provide Eligible Persons with an opportunity to share in the growth in value of the Shares and to encourage them to improve the performance of the Group's return to shareholders. It is intended that the Plan will enable the Group to retain and attract skilled and experienced employees and provide them with the motivation to make the Group more successful.

## **Commencement of Plan**

> The Plan will take effect on and from such date as the Board may resolve.

## **Advice**

> Eligible Persons should obtain their own independent advice (at their own expense) on the financial, taxation and other consequences to them of, or relating to, participation in the Plan.

## **Operation of the Plan**

> The Plan operates according to these Rules which bind each Group Company and each Eligible Person.

# **Administration**

## **Administration of Plan and delegation**

### The Plan is to be administered by the Board.

### The Board may delegate some or all of its powers in administering the Plan to a sub committee of the Board.

### Subject to these Rules, the Board or any sub-committee appointed to administer the Plan shall have the power:

#### to select the Eligible Persons;

#### to determine the terms and conditions of any Offer, including:

##### the number of Options the subject of the Offer;

##### the purchase price (if any) for those Options;

##### any trustee or nominee holding arrangements required to be entered into in connection with those Options;

#### to determine appropriate procedures, regulations and guidelines for the administration of the Plan; and

#### to take advice in relation to the exercise of any of its powers or discretions under these Rules.

## **Calculations and adjustments**

> Any calculations or adjustments which are required to be made by the Board or any sub committee of the Board, in connection with the Plan or these Rules will, in the absence of manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all Eligible Persons and Optionholders.

## **Absolute discretion**

> Where these Rules provide for a determination, decision, declaration or approval of the Board or any sub-committee of the Board, such determination, decision, declaration or approval may be made or given by the body in its absolute discretion.

## **Powers to be exercised by the Board**

> Any power or discretion which is conferred on the Board by these Rules may be exercised by the Board in the interests, or for the benefit, of the Company and the Board is not under any fiduciary or other obligation to any other person.

## **Nominee**

> Upon receipt of an Offer, an Eligible Person may, by notice in writing to the Board, nominate a Nominee in whose favour the Eligible Person wishes to renounce the Offer. The Board may, in its discretion, resolve not to allow a renunciation of an Offer in favour of a Nominee without giving any reason for that decision.

# **Vesting of Options** 

## What vesting conditions may be set

### An Offer may specify any:

#### vesting conditions; or

#### other vesting events,

> which must be satisfied before an Option vests.

### Subject to rule 15, the Board may determine or vary any:

#### vesting conditions; or

#### other vesting events,

> in respect of any Option.

## **Options only vest if vesting conditions/events satisfied**

> An Option will only vest on the occurrence or satisfaction of the condition or other vesting events specified in respect of that Option.

## **How to exercise an Option**

> An Optionholder may exercise an Outstanding Option during the Exercise Period, by:

### giving to the Company a signed Exercise Notice; and

### paying the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Options being exercised, 

### \[[optional for Companies that may rely on the New ESS Rules]{.mark}\] provided that within the immediate 4 years prior to the time of payment, the aggregate amount paid or payable by an Optionholder under clause 4.3(b), less the aggregate amount paid or payable by an Optionholder that satisfies section 1100ZB of the Corporations Act, is not greater than the monetary cap defined in section 1100ZA(5) of the Corporations Act. 

### **\[[Optional - if the option Exercise Period is limited]{.mark}\] When Options lapse**

### Any Option not exercised within \[[insert years]{.mark}\] following the date it is granted will immediately lapse on the \[[insert]{.mark}\] anniversary of the date it is granted. 

# **Treatment of Options for leavers**

## **Good Leavers**

> If an Eligible Person is a Good Leaver:

### all unvested Options automatically lapse with effect on the date the Eligible Person becomes a Good Leaver; and 

### all Outstanding Options do not lapse, 

### unless otherwise determined by the Board.

## **Bad Leavers**

### If an Eligible Person is a Bad Leaver:

#### all unvested Options and Outstanding Options automatically lapse with effect on the date the Eligible Person becomes a Bad Leaver, unless otherwise determined by the Board; and

#### if the Board determines under rule 5.2(a)(i) that Outstanding Options do not automatically lapse with effect on the date the Eligible Person becomes a Bad Leaver, the Board may within 30 days after the Eligible Person becomes a Bad Leaver:

##### give notice to the Optionholder giving them 30 days in which to exercise any Outstanding Options held by that Optionholder. Any Outstanding Options which are not exercised within that period will automatically lapse; and/or

##### serve a notice in writing on the Optionholder (**Transfer Notice**), requiring the Optionholder to sell some or all of his or her Options (**Transfer Options**) to any person nominated by the Board at \[[50]{.mark}\]% of the Fair Market Value of the Options as at the date that the Eligible Person becomes a Bad Leaver.

### If the Board issues a Transfer Notice, the relevant Optionholder must transfer the Transfer Options in accordance with the Transfer Notice and completion of the sale of the Transfer Options must occur on the date determined by the Board and notified to the relevant Optionholder.

### Notwithstanding anything else in these Rules, if the Company subsequently becomes aware that an Eligible Person who was treated as a Good Leaver when they ceased being employed or engaged by a Group Company:

### committed an act during the course of their employment or engagement with a Group Company, that would have constituted them being a Bad Leaver; or

### breaches the provisions of any applicable restrictive covenants (including any non-competition or non-solicitation covenants) between the Eligible Person and a Group Company during the relevant period(s) as prescribed in such restrictive covenants (which may include a period after the cessation of the Eligible Person's employment or engagement with a Group Company), 

## the Eligible Person immediately becomes a Bad Leaver, and all provisions in relation to Bad Leaver in these Rules apply (including clauses 5.2, 6.1 and 6.2). For the avoidance of doubt, immediately upon the Eligible Person becomeing a Bad Leaver, the Board can take all actions, including to cancel, transfer or buy-back, that Eligible Person's Options and Option Shares, as provided in these Rules in respect of Bad Leavers.

# **Treatment of Option Shares for leavers**

## **Right to buyback or direct the transfer of Option Shares**

### If an Eligible Person is a Bad Leaver **\[[Alternative -- delete if Company may ONLY buy back shares if Eligible Person is a Bad Leaver]{.mark}\]** or a Good Leaver **[\[End Alternative\]]{.mark}**, the Board may: 

#### give notice to the Eligible Person of its intention to buy back some or all of the Option Shares (Leaver Securities) held by the Participant at the price set out in rule 6.2; or

#### direct the Participant to transfer the Leaver Securities to a person nominated by the Board at the price set out in rule 6.2.

### If the Board notifies the Eligible Person that it wishes to buy back the Leaver Securities under rule 6.1(a)(i), the Participant must do everything necessary to facilitate the sale of the Leaver Securities free from Security Interests to the Company within 5 Business Days of the Board\'s notice, including entering into a buy back agreement and share transfer documentation. 

### Despite rules 6.1(a)(i) and 6.1(b), the Company may only buy back the Leaver Securities if it is permitted to do so under Part 2J.1 of the Corporations Act.

### If the Board directs the Leaver Securities free from Security Interests to be transferred under rule 6.1(a)(ii), the relevant Participant must transfer the Leaver Securities as directed and completion of the sale of the Leaver Securities must occur on the date determined by the Board and notified to the relevant Eligible Person.

## **Purchase price of Leaver Securities** 

> The price for the Leaver Securities is:

### **\[[Optional rule -- retain if Company may buy back shares if Eligible Person is a Good Leaver]{.mark}\]** if the Eligible Person is a Good Leaver, 100% of Fair Market Value; and

### if the Eligible Person is a Bad Leaver, \[[50]{.mark}\]% of Fair Market Value. **\[[KLG Note: If needed, another category of "Leaver" can be created where an employee has committed a particularly damaging act (e.g. infringement of IP) and for which they should receive the lower of (1) the exercise price of their Option Shares and (2) \[30%\] of Fair Market Value]{.mark}\]**

> The price for the Leaver Securities must be paid by the Company or the transferee (as applicable) on the date on which the Leaver Securities are bought back by the Company or transferred to the transferee (as applicable).

## **Other remedies**

> The rights and remedies set out in this rule 6 do not exclude any other rights or remedies that a Group Company may have against an Eligible Person (or Nominee).

## **Suspension**

> To the extent that the law allows, from the date the Board gives notice or makes a determination under rule 6.1(a), the rights of that Eligible Person (or the relevant Participant) as a holder of Option Shares (including dividend and distribution rights in relation to Option Shares and the rights to attend and vote at general meetings of Shareholders and to receive information and documents) are suspended until those Option Shares have been bought back by the Company or transferred in accordance with this rule 6.

## **These rules not a buy back agreement**

> These Rules do not constitute a buy back agreement in respect of Leaver Securities.

# **Disposal**

## **Restrictions on a sale of Options and Option Shares**

> **\[[Alternative 1]{.mark}\]** Subject to rule 7.2, Options and Option Shares may not be transferred, except:

### in connection with an Exit Event; or

### with the prior written consent of the Board and otherwise in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement (if any).

> **\[[Alternative 2]{.mark}\]**

### Subject to rule 7.2, Options may not be transferred, except:

#### in connection with an Exit Event; or

#### with the prior written consent of the Board.

### Subject to the restriction on Disposal in rule 7.4, Option Shares may only be transferred in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement. If there is no Shareholders Agreement, then the Disposal provisions in rules 7.1(c) and 7.2 apply to Option Shares as well as Options. 

## **Permitted Disposals**

> Subject to the restriction on Disposal in rule 7.4, a legal or beneficial interest in an Option or Option Share may be Disposed of pursuant to:

### a transfer by an Eligible Person of any of its Options to a Nominee, and any such Nominee may transfer Options to any other Nominee provided that no beneficial interest in the Options passes as a result of the transfer and the transfer has been consented to in writing by the Board;

### a transfer of Options by an Optionholder who is a natural person to the trustee or trustees of a family trust set up for the benefit of that person's family provided that the transfer has been consented to in writing by the Board, and the person(s) acquiring Options pursuant to this rule 7.2(b) is (are) not entitled to transfer any Options except for a transfer to the person from whom the transferee acquired the Options;

### to in the event of the death of an Optionholder, a transfer or transmission of the deceased Optionholder's Options to the deceased Optionholder's estate;

### a transfer by an Optionholder of any of its Options where such transfer has been consented to in writing by the Board; or

### a sale or transfer by an Optionholder of any of its Options where such sale or transfer is otherwise permitted or required by these Rules.

> In respect of the Option Shares only, to the extent this rule is inconsistent with any similar provision in the Shareholders Agreement, the provision in the Shareholders Agreement will prevail.

## **Restriction on Disposal after Listing**

> Unless otherwise consented to by the Board in writing and notwithstanding any other provision in these Rules or an Offer, if a Participant holds an Option Share at the date of a Listing, the Participant must not Dispose of a legal or a beneficial interest in an Option Share until on or after the earlier of:

### the date that is 180 days following the Listing; and

### the expiration of any underwriter imposed lock-up in connection with the Listing.

## **Overriding restriction on Disposal in first 3 years**

> Unless a Participant disposes of an Option or an Option Share under an arrangement which meets the requirements in section 83A-130 of the Tax Act, a legal or a beneficial interest in an Option or an Option Share may not be Disposed of until the earlier of:

### 3 years after the issue of the Option or such earlier time as the Commissioner of Taxation allows in accordance with section 83A-45(5) of the Tax Act; and

### the date that the Eligible Person ceases to be employed or engaged by a Group Company.

# **Issue of Ordinary Shares on exercise**

## **Rights attaching to Shares issued to Optionholders on exercise of Outstanding Options**

### Subject to rule 8.2(a), if an Optionholder validly exercises Outstanding Options, the Company must:

#### issue the number of Ordinary Shares which corresponds with the number of Outstanding Options exercised, free from any Security Interest;

#### issue to the Optionholder (or its Nominee) a share certificate for those Ordinary Shares and enter the Optionholder (or its Nominee) into the Company's share register; and

#### lodge with the ASIC the relevant forms to reflect the issue of the relevant number of Option Shares.

### All Option Shares issued on exercise of Options in accordance with this rule 8 will:

#### be issued as fully paid;

#### be free of any Security Interests; and

#### rank equally in all respects with the other Ordinary Shares on issue in the Company as at the date of issue and be subject to the terms of these Rules, the Constitution and Shareholders Agreement (if any).

## **Shareholders Agreement**

### Despite anything else in these Rules, if there is a Shareholders Agreement in place, unless the Board otherwise determines, no Optionholder (or its Nominee) may receive any Option Shares upon the exercise of Options, unless:

#### the Optionholder or Nominee (as applicable) first executes and delivers to the Company a document (in the form prescribed by the Board) pursuant to which the Optionholder or Nominee (as applicable) accedes to, and becomes bound by, the terms of the Shareholders Agreement; or

#### the Optionholder or Nominee (as applicable) is already a party to the Shareholders Agreement.

### If at the time of exercise of an Option the Company does not have a Shareholders Agreement in place, an Optionholder agrees, by serving an Exercise Notice, to enter into (or procure that its Nominee enters into) a Shareholders Agreement if the Company subsequently adopts one, provided that such Shareholders Agreement is not manifestly unfair to the Optionholder. By serving an Exercise Notice on the Company, an Optionholder will be taken to have agreed to this requirement.

# **Procedure on Restructure or Reconstruction**

## **Restructure**

> If there is a Restructure, the New Holding Entity or any Related Body Corporate of the New Holding Entity must grant new options in substitution of some or all of the Options on a like for like basis.

## **Reconstruction**

### In the event of any reconstruction of the share capital of the Company prior to the exercise of the Options (including consolidation, subdivision, reduction, capital return, buy back or cancellation), the number of Option Shares that may be acquired by an Optionholder on exercise of their Options and/or the consideration (if any) payable by an Optionholder for the exercise of their Options must be reconstructed accordingly, in a manner that does not result in any additional benefits being conferred on an Optionholder that are not conferred on shareholders of the Company.

### The Board must give notice to each Optionholder of any adjustment to the Options and/or Option Shares to which that Optionholder is entitled pursuant to the provisions of rule 9.2(a).

# **Procedure on Exit Event**

## **Vesting of Options on Exit**

### **\[[Alternative]{.mark}\]** All unvested Options granted at least one year prior to the date of an Exit Event will automatically vest with effect immediately prior to completion of the Exit Event. 

### The Board will determine whether any unvested Options granted less than one year prior to the date of an Exit Event will vest with effect immediately prior to completion of the Exit Event. 

### \[[Any unvested Options lapse on the occurrence of the Exit Event]{.mark}.\]

### **\[[Alternative]{.mark}\]** Unvested Options will not automatically vest with effect immediately prior to completion of the Exit Event, unless otherwise determined by the Board. 

### \[[All unvested options lapse on completion of the Exit Event]{.mark}.\]

## **Treatment of Options on Exit Event**

### Prior to an Exit Event, the Board must notify an Optionholder of the upcoming Exit Event and provide reasonable details of the Exit Event. 

### Prior to an Exit Event, the Board must either:

#### cancel some or all of the Outstanding Options by paying the Optionholder the amount per Ordinary Share that will be paid under the Exit Event, less the Optionholder's proportionate share of transaction costs; or

#### make appropriate arrangements to ensure that all Outstanding Options are able to be exercised on or prior to the Exit Date (including providing the Optionholders with all information required by sections 1100X and 1100Y(4) of the Corporations Act at least 14 days prior to the Exit Date) and use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Option Shares issued at or about the time of an Exit Event are accorded the same rights and receive the same benefits in relation to the Exit Event as pre-existing Ordinary Shares.

### If the Board undertakes the action set out in rule 10.2(b)(ii), any Outstanding Options as at the date of completion of the Exit Event automatically lapse on completion of the Exit Event.

## **Drag along**

### On or prior to the Exit Date, the Board must if requested to do so by the Majority Shareholders (**Dragging Shareholders**) issue a notice (**Drag Along Notice**) to each Eligible Person or his or her Nominee holding Options or Option Shares (**Dragged Holder**) stating that they want the Dragged Holder to sell all of its Option Shares to:

#### a third party buyer in connection with a Share Sale; or

#### an IPO Entity in connection with a Listing.

### The Drag Along Notice must specify:

#### the number of Shares which the Dragging Shareholders propose to sell (**Sale Shares**), which must be all of the Shares held by those Dragging Shareholders;

#### the name of the proposed buyer of the Sale Shares (**Third Party Buye**r), and the material terms on which the Dragging Shareholders propose to sell the Sale Shares;

#### that the Third Party Buyer is either:

##### a prospective third party purchaser who has made an offer to purchase the Sale Shares at the price and on the terms set out in the Drag Along Notice; or

##### an IPO Entity; 

#### the sale price per Share (which may be cash consideration, scrip consideration or a combination of both cash and scrip); and

#### that the Dragging Shareholders require the Dragged Holder to sell all of the Dragged Holder's Option Shares to the Third Party Buyer in accordance with this rule 10.3.

### A Drag-Along Notice is irrevocable.

### If the Dragging Shareholders serve a Drag Along Notice, then subject to rule 7.4, a Dragged Holder must as part of the sale of the Sale Shares to the Third Party Buyer, sell all of its Option Shares to the Third Party Buyer on terms which comply with rules 10.3(f) and 10.3(g).

### If the Dragged Holder is prevented from Disposing of their Option Shares under rule 7.4, then this rule 10.3 will not apply to the Dragged Holder in respect of those Option Shares.

### The sale of the Dragged Holder's Option Shares to the Third Party Buyer under this rule 10.3 must be for the same sale price per Share and on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the sale by the Dragging Shareholders of the Sale Shares to the Third Party Buyer.

### The Dragging Shareholders must procure that the purchase price payable for the Dragged Holder's Option Shares is paid on the closing of the purchase and sale, which must take place at the same time as the closing of the sale of the Sale Shares by the Dragging Shareholders to the Third Party Buyer.

### Without limiting rule 10.3(d), on completion of the purchase and sale of the Dragged Holder's Option Shares, the Dragged Holder must deliver to the Third Party Buyer:

#### the share certificates and an executed transfer for the Dragged Holder's Option Shares; and

#### a duly executed notice irrevocably appointing the Third Party Buyer as the Dragged Holder's proxy in respect of the Dragged Holder's Option Shares until such time as those Option Shares are registered in the name of the Third Party Buyer.

### To the extent of any inconsistency between this rule 10.3 and the provisions of the Shareholders Agreement, the provisions of the Shareholders Agreement will prevail. 

# **Listings**

> Each Participant agrees and represents that:

### if a Listing is proposed by the Board, it will do all things and provide all assistance as is reasonably required by the Company in connection with the actual or proposed Listing, including, if required by the Company, entering into an underwriting, escrow or offer management agreement or similar agreement on market terms; and

### if, as part of the Listing, the Option Shares or the shares held in the IPO Entity (as applicable) (together, the **Listing Shares**) are subject to the Listing Rules (including, without limitation, if the holder's Listing Shares are "restricted securities" for the purpose of the Listing Rules), each holder will hold and deal with its Listing Shares in accordance with the Listing Rules.

# **Option does not give Shareholder rights**

### An Offer will be in respect of a single grant of Options and does not entitle a Participant to participate in any subsequent grants.

### An Option does not confer on a Participant:

#### any voting rights in respect of Shares or in respect of any other equity securities of the Company;

#### the right to participate in new issues of Shares or other equity securities of the Company;

#### the right to attend or vote at any general meeting or other meeting of holders of any Shares or other equity securities of the Company;

### Each Participant declares that all acts, matters and things done by the Company or any other attorney in exercising powers under rule 13.1 will be as good and valid as if they had been done by that Participant.

## **Indemnity**

> Each Participant indemnifies the Company and each other person who exercises powers under rule 13.1 against all liability and loss arising from and all costs incurred in connection with an exercise of powers under rule 13.1.

# **Employment rights**

## **Acknowledgement by Eligible Person** 

> It is acknowledged and accepted by each Participant that:

### neither these Rules nor any contract formed between the Company and a Participant under the Plan form part of any contract or terms and conditions of employment or appointment, or any arrangement in respect of any such employment or appointment, between an Eligible Person and a Group Company, nor do they constitute a related condition or collateral arrangement to any such contract or arrangement;

### participation in the Plan will not in any way affect the rights and obligations of an Eligible Person under the terms under which he or she is employed or appointed; and

**Rules**

Your participation in the Plan, and the acquisition by you of the Options, is subject to this Offer and the Rules. You should read the Rules in conjunction with this Offer.

This Offer should be interpreted in accordance with the Rules. If there is any conflict between this Offer and the Rules, the Rules will prevail.

The Rules and this Offer and any other documents or arrangements associated with the Plan are not of themselves, and do not in any way form part of, the terms and conditions of your employment, or any contracts, arrangements, related conditions or collateral arrangements under which you perform any work.

**Tax**

We recommend that you consult your taxation or financial adviser in relation to the taxation implications of participating in the Plan. The summary of the tax considerations relevant to the Plan outlined below is not intended to provide you or any other employee with taxation advice. The summary is general in nature and does not take into account the specific taxation circumstances of any individual participant. The taxation consequences may, and probably will, vary depending upon the particular circumstances of any individual participant. Accordingly you should seek your own independent taxation advice before applying to participate in the Plan.

The Company considers that this Offer will qualify to access the 'start-up' tax concessions in the tax legislation. On that basis:

-   you will not be taxed on grant, vesting or exercise of the Options;

-   you will only be taxed on transfer of the Option Shares or Options;

-   for capital gains tax (**CGT**) purposes, the Option Shares you receive on exercise of the Options will be deemed to have been acquired on the day the Options are granted; and

-   any gain or loss you make on disposal of the Option Shares or Options will be assessed under the CGT rules. Provided you were granted the Options at least 12 months prior to disposing of the Option Shares or Options, you should be entitled to apply the CGT discount to reduce the gain, after applying any current or prior year capital losses.

**Financial advice**

Any advice given by or on behalf of the Company in connection with this Offer is general advice only. You should consider obtaining your own financial product advice from an independent person who is licensed by ASIC to give that advice.

**Accepting this Offer**

You may accept this Offer by returning to the Company by \[[5:00 pm AEST]{.mark}\] on \[[insert date]{.mark}\] a signed copy of the Acceptance of Offer attached to this letter as Attachment 1.

Yours sincerely

**Director**

I agree that the Rules, the Offer, the Shareholders Agreement (if any) and the Constitution are fair and reasonable having regard to the interests of the parties.

I irrevocably appoint each director from time to time of the Company severally as my attorney (**Attorney**) only to the extent necessary to satisfy my obligations under and to give effect to the Plan and the Rules. Each Attorney has the power to:

6.  do any other thing (whether or not of the same kind as the above) which in the Attorney's opinion is necessary, expedient or desirable to give effect to the provisions of this deed.

I acknowledge that each Attorney may exercise the powers of an Attorney under this deed even if the Attorney benefits from the exercise of that power.

I undertake to ratify and confirm any act of each Attorney in exercise of the powers of attorney under this deed.

I acknowledge and accept that:

1.  neither the Rules nor this Offer form part of any contract or terms and conditions of my employment or appointment, or any arrangement in respect of any such employment or appointment, nor do they constitute a related condition or collateral arrangement to any such contract or arrangement;

2.  participation in the Plan will not in any way affect my rights and obligations under the terms under which I am employed or appointed;

3.  the terms of my employment or appointment with a Group Company will not in any way affect my rights and obligations under the Plan;

5.  if the Board terminates or suspends the Plan, no compensation under my employment contract will be payable to me;

6.  except as expressly provided in the Rules, participation under the Plan does not confer on me any right to acquire Options or Option Shares;

7.  the value of Options or Option Shares do not increase my income or remuneration for the purpose of calculating any employee benefits, including any payment in lieu of notice or redundancy or severance payments; and

8.  participation under the Plan does not confer on me any right to future employment and does not affect any rights which any Group Company may have to terminate my employment.

This deed is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of [\[insert]{.mark}\].

**Rules**

Your participation in the Plan, and the acquisition by you of the Options, is subject to this Offer and the Rules. You should read the Rules in conjunction with this Offer.

This Offer should be interpreted in accordance with the Rules. If there is any conflict between this Offer and the Rules, the Rules will prevail.

The Rules and this Offer and any other documents or arrangements associated with the Plan are not of themselves, and do not in any way form part of, the terms and conditions of your employment, or any contracts, arrangements, related conditions or collateral arrangements under which you perform any work.

**Risks**

Your Options and any Option Shares that you may be issued upon exercise of your Options may not have any value. The value of your Options (or Option Shares) will depend on future events that may not occur. You should consider the risks of acquiring and holding the Options (or Option Shares) carefully before accepting this Offer or exercising your Options.

The principal business activities of the Company are \[***[insert principal business activities]{.mark}***\]. Some risks stemming from these business activities are as follows:

***\[[Note: Companies should consider whether the below suggested wordings are applicable to each of them and whether there are any other risks of acquiring and holding interests in the Company should be included.]{.mark}***\]

-   Global economic conditions may affect a number of factors that are key to the Company\'s business, including inflation and interest rates, which in turn may impact upon the Company\'s operating costs, financing and ability to win customers\' business. If the Company is unable to attract new customers or to sell additional products to its existing customers, the Company\'s revenue growth may be adversely affected and its net income could decrease;

-   A downturn in the global technology industry may adversely affect the Company\'s business and curtail its growth opportunities;

-   In the event that an Exit Event does not occur, the Options and any Option Shares that you may be issued upon exercise of your Options may never become liquid and as a result, you may have to hold them indefinitely;

-   The Company may elect to issue additional securities in the future for a variety of reasons including for capital and operational needs, including the buy other businesses. Shareholders and holders of Options may be diluted as a result of future issues of securities;

-   In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is subject to the risk of litigation and other disputes with its employees, clients, regulators, partners, competitors or other third parties. Legal proceedings and the associated costs may have an adverse effect on the financial performance of its business;

-   The Company may face competition from new entrants into the industry, which may draw customers away from using the Company\'s products; and

-   \[***[insert other potential risks]{.mark}***\].

Some of these risks can be mitigated by the Company\'s use of safeguards and appropriate systems and actions, but many are outside the control of the Company and cannot be mitigated. The risks set out above do not reflect all the risks.

**Tax**

We recommend that you consult your taxation or financial adviser in relation to the taxation implications of participating in the Plan. The summary of the tax considerations relevant to the Plan outlined below is not intended to provide you or any other employee with taxation advice. The summary is general in nature and does not take into account the specific taxation circumstances of any individual participant. The taxation consequences may, and probably will, vary depending upon the particular circumstances of any individual participant. Accordingly you should seek your own independent taxation advice before applying to participate in the Plan, exercising your Options or transferring or disposing of your Options or Option Shares.

The Company considers that this Offer will qualify to access the 'start-up' tax concessions in the tax legislation. On that basis:

-   you will not be taxed on grant, vesting or exercise of the Options;

-   you will only be taxed on transfer of the Option Shares or Options;

-   for capital gains tax (**CGT**) purposes, the Option Shares you receive on exercise of the Options will be deemed to have been acquired on the day the Options are granted; and

-   any gain or loss you make on disposal of the Option Shares or Options will be assessed under the CGT rules. Provided you were granted the Options at least 12 months prior to disposing of the Option Shares or Options, you should be entitled to apply the CGT discount to reduce the gain, after applying any current or prior year capital losses.

**Financial and legal advice**

Any advice given by or on behalf of the Company in connection with this Offer is general advice only and does not take into account your objectives, financial situation and needs. You should consider obtaining your own independent professional legal and financial product advice in relation to your participation in the Plan, prior to accepting this Offer.

**Limitation of liability**

To the extent any information in this Offer or other supporting information required by section 1100Y(4) of the Corporations Act, is untrue or becomes out of date, the Company will provide you with an updated Offer or supporting information (as necessary), in accordance with section 1100Z(1) of the Corporations Act.

For the purposes of and to the extent permitted under section 1100Z(3) of the Corporations Act, the Company, its directors, any proposed directors and any other person named in the table to section 1100Z(2) of the Corporations Act is not liable for any loss or damage suffered by you because of a contravention of a term of the offer covered by section 1100Z(1)(a), (b) or (c) of the Corporations Act.
