[^1]: At its simplest, a Convertible Note enables the Investor to make a cash loan to the Company, that converts into shares in the Company on a future event occurring (ie a capital raising) on the terms of the Convertible Note.

[^2]: A key difference between a convertible note and a SAFE is that a convertible note will often include a maturity date (being the date upon which the note must either convert or be redeemed).

[^3]: An Investor may want to enter into a separate side letter with the Company to secure pre-emptive rights and information rights during the period of the Convertible Note, given that the Investor may not be a shareholder during that time.

[^4]: Convertible Notes generally have a face value of \$1, creating a 1:1 ratio relative to the purchase amount.

[^5]: This is a post-money convertible note, meaning that it takes into account all other convertible instruments (SAFEs, other convertible notes, options, and warrants etc.) when determining the conversion price on conversion of the notes.

[^6]: The Maturity Date is the date on which the Convertible Notes will automatically convert into Shares if they have not already converted or redeemed (in relation to a Default Event) in accordance with this deed. Sometimes the Investor has the discretion to decide if the Convertible Notes will convert or be redeemed (meaning that the Outstanding Amount must be repaid by the Company) on the Maturity Date.

[^7]: The Qualifying Financing can be tied to a minimum fundraising round (ie a capital raising of at least \$X at a pre-money valuation of at least \$Y).

[^8]: One of the main differences between a SAFE and a Convertible Note, is that Convertible Notes often charge interest. The rate of interest is a commercial decision that should be agreed with the Company and the Investor.

[^9]: This convertible note includes simple interest, while it is also common for investors to request compounding interest, with the interest often compounding in monthly, six-monthly or annual periods.

[^10]: This deed calculates the number of shares that the Investor would receive on a future capital raising (called a Qualifying Financing) on the higher of a formula that uses a pre-agreed valuation cap and a formula that applies a discount rate to the price per share issued in that priced round. It is not uncommon for the calculation to be done by reference only to a discount rate.

[^11]: Some investors may require the discretion to receive a cash payment in respect of the Convertible Notes on an Exit Event to be removed, for regulatory reasons. It can either be removed in this document, or often the relevant investor and the Company can enter into a side letter in which the investor waives its right to receive a cash payment pursuant to this clause.

[^12]: Note: these are basic warranties, and some investors may require more substantive warranties from the Company, such as the status of the Company\'s intellectual property rights, financial accounts and so on.
