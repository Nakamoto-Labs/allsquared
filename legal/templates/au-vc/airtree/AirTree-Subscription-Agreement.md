        a.  any fiduciary or confidential relationship;

[^1]: This agreement is drafted on the basis that there is more than one Investor. Some changes will be required if there is only a single Investor under this agreement.

[^2]: This agreement is drafted on the basis that there is more than one Founder. Again, some changes will be required if there is only a single Founder under this agreement.

[^3]: If the parties agree that the Founders will not give any Warranties, the Founders do not need to be a party to the Agreement and all references to Founder Warranties and related provisions can be deleted.

[^4]: Investors will typically require a company to warrant the accuracy of both a set of annual financial statements (often referred to as the Accounts) and a more recent set of management accounts (the Management Accounts).

[^5]: The Completion Date may be the date of the agreement if the parties want to exchange this subscription agreement and complete the issuance of the shares simultaneously.

[^6]: It may be helpful to introduce a concept of a \'lead investor\' who can make decisions like this on behalf of the investors.

[^7]: Investors will often require disclosure to be limited to matters disclosed in a disclosure letter and/or a data room. Some investors (particularly overseas-based venture funds) will push back on the idea of the data room being disclosed. Market practice in both the US and the UK is not to allow for a broad disclosure \'shield\' and instead require relevant matters to be set out in a disclosure schedule or disclosure letter if they are to qualify the Warranties. In Australia, investors are often (but not always) willing to accept that the Warranties also be qualified by reference to documents contained in a data room (subject to the relevant matters being fully and fairly disclosed). Either approach will need to be negotiated between the parties.

[^8]: The Founder Warranties are statements relating to the Founders personally and are a common request from Investors looking for confirmation that the Founders are fit and proper persons to operate the business and not subject to any restrictions (eg non-compete restraints) that might adversely affect the Business. If the parties agree that the Founders will not give the Founder Warranties, the Founders do not need to be a party to the Agreement and all references to Founder Warranties and related provisions can be deleted.

[^9]: This Subscription Agreement is drafted on the basis that a New Constitution will be adopted on or before Completion and that that New Constitution includes the terms governing the Seed Preference Shares that are to be issued to the Investors at Completion.

[^10]: This may be extended to specifically cover the knowledge of other employees who are not Founders. Certain Founders may request to remove the words \"and the awareness, knowledge or belief they would have had after making due and careful enquiry\" as this expands the breadth of their imputed knowledge. However, Investors generally require this to avoid a situation where the Founders can claim ignorance of a matter of which they should have been aware. A common middle ground is to limit the scope of the enquiries required (eg to enquiries of the Founder\'s direct reports or to a list of named individuals).

[^11]: This agreement is drafted on the basis that all Subscription Shares will be subscribed for at a single Completion.

[^12]: Consider whether any conditions precedent to Completion are required. For example, Completion could be conditional on (1) the renewal of a key contract, (2) finance being obtained by the Investor, or (3) the consummation of another business transaction. If conditions precedent are to be included, the parties should consider including a date by which the conditions precedent must be satisfied such that, if they are not satisfied by that date, a party should be able to terminate the transaction.

[^13]: Consider whether any pre-completion covenants are required for the period between signing and completion, particularly if there will be a lengthy period between signing and completion to allow for conditions precedent to be satisfied. These may include provisions that (1) require the business to be run in the ordinary course (2) give Investors consent rights over key decisions of the business (similar to any consent rights that they may have post-completion) and/or (3) ensure that the capital structure of the Company does not change during the period between signing and completion.

[^14]: If an Investor has the right to appoint a director to the Company, then it will be necessary to include an obligation on the incoming director nominee of the Investor to deliver a consent to act as director to the Company.

[^15]: If an investor will be appointing a Director (see footnote 14), then the investor may require entry by the Company and the Director into a Director\'s Deed of Access, Indemnity and Insurance. If so, the investor will need to deliver to the Company a Director\'s Deed of Access, Indemnity and Insurance. This will need to be an obligation of the Investor to procure the signature of the director on that document.

[^16]: Consider whether any further completion deliverables are required. For example, (1) employment agreements with key personnel, (2) transfer of assets from the name of the Founder to the name of the Company etc. Note also that other internal approvals may be required (eg if required under a pre-existing shareholders agreement and/or constitution).

[^17]: If the Investors are satisfied with the existing employment agreements, then this can be deleted.

[^18]: If the Investors are satisfied that the relevant IP is already held by a Group Company, then this can be deleted.

[^19]: If the Founders are not giving any Warranties, then delete all references to the Founders in this clause 5 (and delete clauses 5.1(b) and 5.4(b) in full).

[^20]: It may be appropriate to include provisions allowing for Claims for breach of Warranty to be settled, at the election of the Investor, through a new issue of shares to the Investor.

[^21]: Some Investors expect to see a \'gross up\' clause in relation to Claims for breach of Warranty which grosses up the amount of the Claim by reference to the Investor\'s shareholding in the Company. This is to prevent the Investor indirectly bearing part of the burden of making good the claim as a result of the Investor\'s shareholding in the Company.

[^22]: Some Investors may require that the Founders give the general Business Warranties (relating to the Company and its Business) alongside the Company (in addition to the Founder Warranties that relate to the Founders themselves). If this is agreed between the parties, this clause should be amended to read \"*The Company and each Founder jointly and severally represents and warrants...*\"

[^23]: Consider whether 24 months is an appropriate length of time. In particular, a longer claims period may be appropriate for title and tax warranties.

[^24]: The Company and Founders may request that there be certain minimum thresholds that have to be reached before the Investor is able to make a claim, to avoid the costs inherent in dealing with small claims. This may apply in respect of each individual claim (e.g. the Company and Founders have no liability for breach of Warranty unless the amount of any Claim arising out of the breach is \$10,000 or more) or in respect of all Claims (e.g. the Company and Founders have no liability for breach of Warranty unless the aggregate amount of all claims is \$100,000 or more) or both. Typically, if these thresholds are included, the Investor will have the right to claim for the whole amount and not just the excess over the threshold.

[^25]: Consider whether to include a dispute resolution clause.

[^26]: If the parties wish to have no rights against each other moving forward, they should release each other separately.

[^27]: It is quite common for the Company to pay one or more investors\' legal fees, particular when dealing with venture capital funds. The Investor will generally not be entitled to a full input tax credit in respect of the GST component of the legal costs, so the GST amount should be included in the amount to be reimbursed to the extent it is not fully creditable in accordance with clause 8.

[^28]: The cap table is presented on a \'fully diluted\' basis, meaning that it includes an allocation for ESOP (and other securities that may be convertible into shares). Parties will need to agree the size of the ESOP pool. Note that it is common for the investor\'s holding percentage to be calculated on a fully diluted basis so that they are not diluted by any increase in the ESOP pool as part of the investment.

[^29]: In the event that there is a shareholders agreement in place prior to the Investor\'s subscription for shares, it is likely that a waiver of pre-emption rights will be required from all existing shareholders in the Company prior to Completion.

[^30]: In some instances, investors may expect a more robust information warranty, including words to the effect that the information has been provided in good faith and that the Group and its Representatives have disclosed and have not knowingly or recklessly withheld from the Investor any information that a subscriber for the Subscription Shares would reasonably require to make an informed assessment of the assets and liabilities, financial position and performance of the Group. The Company should consider whether it is inappropriate, in the circumstances, to give such a broad information warranty.

[^31]: The Accounts (and Management Accounts) warranties should be carefully tailored to reflect the nature of the financial statements that are being warranted. By way of example, a company may be more willing to give robust warranties regarding the accuracy of its annual financial statements (particular if these have been audited) than the accuracy of any management accounts.

[^32]: Delete if not applicable, for example if the Company is relying on the \'*small scale offerings*\' exemption under s 708(1) of the Corporations Act.

[^33]: Use this execution block where the Company has two or more directors; or one director and a company secretary.

[^34]: Use this execution block where the Company has only 1 director and either than director is the sole company secretary or the Company has no company secretary. Please choose the appropriate wording underneath the signing line.

[^35]: Founder execution blocks should be deleted if Founders are not a party to this agreement.
