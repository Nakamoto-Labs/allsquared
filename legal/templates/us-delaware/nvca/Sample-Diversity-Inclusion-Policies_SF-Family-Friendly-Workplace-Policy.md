**[NVCA Sample Diversity & Inclusion Policies -- San Francisco Family Friendly Workplace Policy]{.underline}**

*The details below are specific to San Francisco flexible workplace policies and are intended for inclusion with your firm's Flex-Time Schedules Policy, a sample of which is provided in the NVCA Sample Diversity & Inclusion Policies, located [here](https://nvca.org/download/60947/).*

The Firm complies with the San Francisco Family Friendly Workplace Ordinance ("FFWO"). Pursuant to the FFWO, eligible employees may request a "flexible or predictable working arrangement" required to assist with care for:

1.  A child under age 18 for whom the employee has assumed parental responsibility (this includes a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis to that child);

2.  The employee's parent who is age 65 or older; or

3.  A person with a "serious health condition" in a "family relationship" with the employee (this includes persons to whom the employee is related by blood, legal custody, marriage, or domestic partnerships, as a spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, sibling, grandchild or grandparent).

**Eligibility**

To be eligible, an employee must:

1.  Be employed in San Francisco;

2.  Have been employed by the Firm for six months or more; and

3.  Work at least eight hours per week on a regular basis.

**Notice Requirement**

Requests for a flexible or predictable working arrangement must be in writing and submitted to Human Resources, on the Firm's Flexible or Predictable Working Arrangement Request Form. Employees should submit their requests well in advance of the date they wish the requested change to take effect, as it may take up to six weeks to consider any request. The Firm will consider requests in compliance with the FFWO, and may deny requests for bona fide business reasons. If a request is denied, the employee will be provided with an opportunity to request reconsideration.

**No Retaliation**

The Firm will not retaliate against any employee for requesting a flexible or predictable working arrangement under the FFWO, for exercising any right under the FFWO, or based on the employee's caregiver status.

Nothing in this policy or the FFWO creates a right to be paid when the Firm does not have sufficient work for the employee. Furthermore, time off under this policy (including, but not limited to, a part-time schedule or other reduced work schedule) may run concurrently with leaves of absence or other time off for which the employee is eligible, as permitted by law.

For more information, please refer to the FFWO poster located in the [\[*e.g.*, break room\]]{.mark} or contact Human Resources.
